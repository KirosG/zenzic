Advisers say this creates the illusion that Obama is looking forward to a bright future, while the downturned corners of his lips indicate that he acknowledges the problems of the present.', u'\n', u""Obama's advisers have created a computer model to simulate the optimal looking-off-into-the-future pose."", u'""The senator spends six hours a day gazing resolutely off into the distance,"" said chief political strategist David Axelrod, who regularly analyzes video of the pose with Obama, pinpoints areas that need improvement, and makes necessary tweaks.', u'""It is critical to get every detail right,"" Axelrod continued.

""This profile sets a benchmark for mindless filler by which all other features about Sen. Obama will now be judged. Just impressive puff-journalism all around.""', u'The 24-page profile, entitled ""Boogyin\' With Barack,"" hit newsstands Monday and contains photos of the candidate as a baby, graduating from Columbia University, standing and laughing, holding hands with his wife and best friend, Michelle, greeting a crowd of blue-collar autoworkers, eating breakfast with diner patrons, and staring pensively out of an airplane window while a pen and legal pad rest comfortably on his lowered tray table.

Obama play endless games of basketball with city firemen to show readers how athletic and youthful he is, but I also had to go to NBA shooting experts to learn what aspects of his jump shot are good and what parts are great.""', u'Sherwood said he was granted full access to the candidate, and was permitted by chief strategist David Axelrod to ask any question he desired\u2014an opportunity the reporter used to lob the easiest softballs at Obama yet, ranging from how happy he felt when he met his wife to what songs are currently on his iPod playlist. Sherwood was also fearless in his effort to paint the candidate as someone who is ""surprisingly down to earth,"" a phrase that is used a total of 26 times throughout the feature. ', u'""If we were going to get the story we wanted, it was my responsibility as a journalist to ask the really tough questions to his two young daughters,"" said Sherwood, who grilled Malia and Sasha Obama, 9 and 7, about whether they were ""proud of [their] daddy."" ""I also had to capitalize on every opportunity to compare the story of Obama\'s upbringing and rise to power to that of Martin Luther King, Jr.\'s and John F. Kennedy\'s, no matter how suspect those parallels really are."" ', u'According to the Time reporter, work on the profile was often harder than he had anticipated, with Obama at times dodging questions about whether or not he played a musical instrument, and about what Monopoly piece he thought best represented his candidacy and why. ', u'""Situations like these are when you have to get on the phone and talk, not only to his mother, but to his aunt, his uncle, a Boy Scout leader, or maybe even one of his camp counselors growing up,"" Sherwood said. ""And if they don\'t return your call, you turn to Sunday school teachers and former babysitters\u2014anyone who is willing to go on record and say that Barack Obama was a really good kid who was destined for great things.""', u'Added Sherwood, ""It\'s all about getting the factoids out in the open.""

John Kerry (D-MA), whom Cooter mistook for an outhouse Monday and urinated on for 35 seconds.', u'""I thought we would be able to escape controversy by leaving the country for a week and visiting Iraq and Europe,"" an unnamed source in the Obama camp told reporters. ""Little did we know that Cooter would command just as much attention back home by getting drunk with the Russian ambassador, lighting off fireworks, and crashing Obama\'s campaign limo into a creek in the Ozark Mountains.""', u""Despite the setbacks he has caused, Cooter has secured a small but devoted following, and has occasionally managed to reflect well on the campaign. At a speaking engagement to which Obama arrived two hours late, Cooter kept the crowd's spirits up by breaking out a washtub string bass and a washboard and holding an impromptu hoedown."", u'Although his primary focus has been to support his brother, Cooter Obama said he is not without political aspirations of his own.', u'""Shoot, I\'m helpin\' because I love my brother,"" Cooter said.

","June 8, 2011",Politics,Our Annual Year 2011,,,,"[u""WASHINGTON\u2014According to a Quinnipiac University poll conducted this week, a homemade anti-Obama sign has surged to the front of the 2012 Republican presidential field, emerging as the clear favorite to earn the party's nomination in next year's primaries."", u'The telephone survey of 773 likely voters indicated the sign, a piece of poster board bearing the handwritten phrase ""NOBAMA 2012"" in bold red letters, would defeat former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, its nearest rival, by a landslide 17 percentage points if the primaries were held today. The poll also found the sign had a ""favorable"" or ""highly favorable"" rating among 94 percent of registered Republicans, a figure greater than all other presumptive GOP candidates combined.', u'""We\'re seeing that voters find the sign more charismatic, more likeable, and much more engaging than other Republican candidates,"" said political analyst Mark Halperin, adding that the poster\'s message resonates strongly with conservatives. ""In the end, it comes down to two things: the ability to energize the party base, and the power to instill confidence and appear presidential. Right now, it\'s the sign by far.""', u'""Frankly,"" Halperin added, ""this is the brightest star to emerge from the Republican ranks in the last several elections.""', u'According to Halperin, the 22-by-28-inch poster emerged as a serious contender for the Republican nomination because it offers a clear, consistent vision and refuses to compromise on its fundamental principles. Beltway insiders have also noted that the slogan ""Liberty, not debt"" on the back of the sign has solidified its appeal with the influential Tea Party bloc.', u'In addition, the sign has been warmly embraced by social conservatives, who are reportedly drawn to its clean image and lack of personal or political baggage. A recent Zogby poll showed that Americans who identified themselves as values voters favored the sign by a staggering 40-to-1 ratio over former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.', u'""I like what that sign has to say,"" said 46-year-old Brandon LaFollette of Florence, SC, adding that while he likes the way the poster addresses all his political and economic concerns, it\'s also the only Republican candidate he could see himself sitting down and having a beer with. ""I agree with its positions on the deficit, health care, unemployment, gas prices\u2014everything. And it\'s not afraid to stand up to the president on every issue.""', u'""Sign 2012!"" he added.', u'Having proved its ability to rally broad segments of the political right, and having suddenly invigorated a campaign season that had been widely considered lackluster and uninspiring, the sign has prompted political pundits to anoint the glossy white placard as ""the new face of the GOP"" and ""a modern-day Ronald Reagan.""', u'""Unfortunately for its competitors, the sign has very few vulnerabilities,"" said GOP strategist Mike Murphy, who claimed the poster was poised to ""coast"" to the Republican nomination next August. ""It communicates to voters in unambiguous, straightforward terms, it\'s photogenic, and it possesses a remarkable ability to stay on message.""', u'""The fact that it set a single-day fundraising record doesn\'t surprise me at all,"" added Murphy, referring to the $40 million haul it received last Tuesday from an estimated 350,000 citizens, the National Right to Life Committee, the Altria Group, dozens of evangelical radio personalities, the National Rifle Association, the energy lobby, and Charles G. and David H. Koch.', u'With both moderate and hard-line conservatives lining up behind the handmade poster, Murphy said the sign should focus on the difficult task of winning over crucial independent voters. He argued that if a seasoned anti-tax bumper sticker or an American flag lapel pin were selected as its running mate, the sign could broaden its standing in swing states and pose a formidable challenge to the incumbent Obama.', u'As the buzz surrounding the sign continues to mount, other Republican candidates have reportedly scrambled to reframe their campaigns and capture a share of the rising voter enthusiasm.', u'""While the sign and I share a common vision for the future, I would hope that voters turn to a candidate with experience,"" former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said. ""I may not have the same gift of rhetorical flourish, and I may not be as magnetic or compelling as the poster, but this shouldn\'t be a popularity contest. If it were, none of us would stand a chance against the sign. We know that.""', u'At press time, Pawlenty had dropped out of the race and was expected to make an announcement Thursday fully endorsing the sign.']"

He is, after all, the president of the United States.

My dad. The man who is raising me, who asks me how school is every day, who takes me to soccer games and reads me stories when I can't fall asleep at night. People want to murder him. They want to murder my father."", u""Doesn't really get more fucked up than that, now, does it?"", u""When we first moved into the White House I was only 7 years old, too young to know that people wanted my dad dead. And I'll tell you what, I was a lot happier then. Now that I'm a little older, though, it's all becoming pretty clear. There aren't just four or five people who want my dad dead. Tons of people want to murder him. Tons. People in this country, people in other countries. The bottom line\u2014and this is the cold, hard reality that I now fully understand\u2014is that every second of every day, people are thinking of ways to kill the person I love and admire more than anyone in the world."", u""Meanwhile, no one is plotting the murder of, say, my friend Amanda's dad. He's a computer technician. No one is trying to assassinate a computer technician. At no point in Amanda's day will she experience a rush of crippling panic due to the fact that, at any moment, a psycho wielding a semiautomatic weapon could step out of the shadows and unload an entire clip into her father's chest, killing him right on the spot."", u""That's just true. You can try to comfort me all you want, but you know damn well that's just a fact."", u""Here's another awful thing I've finally started to understand: The chances of somebody killing my father are so high that there is an entire force of men and women whose singular responsibility is to prevent that from happening. These people are specially trained. They create intricate plans specifically designed to protect my father, because no matter where he goes, somebody in the area probably wants to kill him. And look, I'm not some na\xefve little girl anymore. I can get on the Internet. I can research American presidents. I know damn well the Secret Service doesn't always succeed.

Though I assumed it would be a somewhat close election, I guess I\u2019d be lying if I said I thought that with 14 days to go I\u2019d be in such a vulnerable position. Because, when it comes down to it, my opponent is Mitt Romney. I\u2019m not exactly running against Dwight D. Eisenhower or Abraham Lincoln or even George H.W. Bush here, you know? I\u2019m running against Mitt Romney\u2014a guy who has made so many conflicting statements on so many different issues that the thought of losing to someone like that leaves me severely depressed, and makes me question if I\u2019ve maybe wasted my entire life. Truth be told, if I do lose on Nov. 6, I think the odds are pretty good that I\u2019ll kill myself.', u'Yeah, I\u2019ll definitely commit suicide if I lose the presidency to Mitt Romney.', u'I think that would be the best, and even the healthiest, thing for me both personally and professionally. The prospect of welcoming President-elect Romney to the White House, or watching Mitt Romney take the oath of office, or continuing my life as a president, husband, and father who lost the most important position in the entire world to the guy who ran the Salt Lake City Olympics just doesn\u2019t seem very appealing to me.

But I can no longer stay quiet about an issue I believe in so firmly.', u'My fellow Americans, it\u2019s time to talk reparations.', u'As you may know, the latest polls show the race in the swing states is tighter than ever, with many crucial voters still undecided. So I realize that forcing the nation into a discussion about atoning for an institution abolished a century and a half ago, and introducing a program to redistribute wealth to black Americans\u2014either in cash, bonds, or via a series of property reallocations\u2014is not the most intelligent move, strategically speaking.

Believe me, it won\u2019t get any easier to discuss, so let\u2019s address this matter once and for all. We\u2019ll all be happier when we\u2019ve rolled up our sleeves, taken several billion dollars from white people and given it to blacks, and put this all behind us.', u'Only then can we finally move forward.', u'Now, Americans have grown accustomed to hearing a lot about jobs, Medicare, and national security in recent months, so I can understand that it will be confusing when I suddenly begin to speak exclusively about making up for this country\u2019s past mistakes by exempting black people from paying all taxes. I know that using the last few days of my campaign to push for a comprehensive reparations plan will, at best, alienate voters and, at worst, incite frustration, disgust, and outright contempt toward me\u2014not to mention irreversibly recast my presidential legacy.', u'But I am a man of moral convictions, and I will not rest until African-Americans receive the fair monetary compensation they deserve.

If you cast your ballot for me, the next four years will be focused pretty much entirely on reparations. That\u2019s my promise to you.', u'Granted, surveys show the vast majority of citizens, including many African-Americans, do not consider this to be an issue worthy of discussion. In fact, my friends and family\u2014even my own wife, who is descended from slaves\u2014have repeatedly sat me down and said, \u201cBarack, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d But the scars of slavery have not healed in this nation, and no matter how many times David Axelrod grabs me by the shoulders and says it is profoundly foolish even to mention this idea, let alone actively work toward it, I believe that in a republic that holds all men are created equal, we must confront this uncomfortable truth and make the appropriate cash payout to every black American, regardless of age, gender, education, criminal background, or income.', u'I\u2019m thinking $150,000 a person.', u'I do not pursue this policy for my family\u2019s personal gain, which will be considerable.

Moreover, the pictures reveal that a nation once filled with hope has been sapped of its energy, most likely the result of the profound day-in-day-out pressures Americans face every time Obama increases the federal deficit, fails to reverse the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthy, is unable to address the country's immigration crisis, or breaks a campaign promise, such as closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay., According to health experts, the country's stress can be tempered with proper diet and exercise, but the physical transformation is unavoidable, especially considering the incredible demands that have been placed on Americans throughout Obama's first term., ""Mental strain begets physical wear and tear—that's nothing new,"" said Dr. Richard Vestum, chief wellness officer at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""But if you have the weight of leading the free world resting on Barack Obama's shoulders, you're experiencing roughly 10 times the anxiety of the average individual in a Western democracy."", ""Imagine waking up every morning knowing that Obama has to make the final call on everything from national security to the economy, and is constantly trying to balance those decisions with what is politically advantageous,"" Vestum added. ""That's a very isolating, powerless feeling that would make any citizen appear more haggard."", Vestum said that during each year of the Obama administration, American citizens have aged the equivalent of three ordinary years. He confirmed the aging process is even more severe among the president's die-hard supporters, who, after experiencing three years of lackluster job performance and Obama's compromising of many cherished Democratic initiatives, have aged roughly five years for each ""Obama year."", Some experts estimate the Obama presi­dency may have shaved five to 10 years off the lifespan of Americans.  , ""Yes, citizens have developed crow's-feet and bags under their eyes, but in their defense, the Obama White House is a pressure cooker for Americans unlike anything most ordinary people will ever experience,"" Democratic strategist Mitch Kaplan said. ""Think about it: You're a United States citizen who has to live with the decision to elect Barack Obama every single day, a decision that constantly affects the entire planet. You'd only sleep four or five hours a night, too."", Sources have confirmed Obama's presidency is not unique in causing rapid aging. George W. Bush's eight years in office left the U.S. populace a wrinkled, shriveled shell of its former self, and the nation aged approximately six years in a mere 18 months as a result of Bill Clinton's sex scandal. Additionally, despite his best efforts, more than 600,000 Americans are believed to have died prematurely when Abraham Lincoln served as commander in chief., ""Being an American citizen and having the fate of the free world in the hands of one of these guys is certainly not easy,"" said 43-year-old Toledo, OH resident Henry Kessler, who, since Obama took office, has lost a majority of his hair and now walks with a slight hitch in his step. ""And in the case of Barack Obama, the longer he's president, the more worried I am about enduring serious, long-term health problems."", ""Thankfully, it only has to last until next January,"" he added., Medical experts agree the overwhelming stress of a Mitt Romney presidency would  kill the entire populace within seconds of his  inauguration.]"

","April 18, 2012",Politics,War For The White House,Barack Obama,Our Annual Year 2012,,"[CHICAGO—After coming to terms with the limited scope of what he can realistically expect to accomplish as president, Barack Obama announced Wednesday a new, more practical campaign slogan that will serve as the cornerstone for his 2012 reelection bid: ""I Have Big Ideas But We'll See How It Goes."", ""My fellow citizens, I stand here today to tell you that, if given a second term, I have very big plans for our nation's future,"" Obama said during a rally at Chicago's Navy Pier. ""Ambitious, forward-thinking plans I will have to drastically scale down based on opinion polls, budget considerations, and political roadblocks, but, you know, I'll see what I can do. No promises, though."", ""More than likely I'll have to placate political rivals until my bold agenda is a shell of what it once was."" Obama added. ""And that's what the 'We'll See' campaign is all about. Now let us go boldly forth and compromise our ideals."", Saying he intends to give certain initiatives a shot but that it's not looking very good, Obama cited lasting bipartisanship cooperation in Congress, birth-control coverage for all women, and an affordable college education for every citizen as concrete examples of ridiculous ideas that Americans need to put out of their minds, because, according to the president, ""We're not living in a fantasyland here."", , Instead, Obama said he hopes to rally voters behind causes like holding teachers accountable for student performances ""while remembering tenure provisions that protect terrible educators from getting fired,"" imposing a surtax on millionaires ""unless of course Republicans fight me really hard, which, in that case, what are you going to do,"" and an economic stimulus bill to fund new infrastructure that ""doesn't have a chance in hell of passing but sure would be nice."", ""Think of the America within our reach: a nation of entrepreneurs and innovators and dreamers capable of making big plans that will eventually be crushed by acrimonious gridlock,"" Obama said to smattering applause. ""That's the future I see for America, because, let's be honest, that's just how it's always going to be."", ""Then again, you never know,"" Obama continued, ""If 50 or 60 key people die, there's a chance some of my policy ideas might at least make it past various Senate and House committees. Fingers crossed."", According to top campaign strategist David Axelrod, the new slogan's message may sideline older themes like hope and change, but it allows Obama to portray himself as the sensible candidate who can think big, back off that thought because it has no chance of actually happening, and then settle for something nowhere near as exciting., Axelrod said the slogan was chosen after a brainstorming session that saw the coining of such phrases as ""Change We Can Believe In If We Critically Redefine The Term,"" ""Hope Within The Boundaries Of Common Sense And Lowered Expectations,"" and ""Look, Any Guy You Vote Into Office Is Going To Face The Same Bullshit Problems Every President—Democrat Or Republican—Has Faced For Decades, So It Might As Well Be Me: Obama 2012."", ""'Yes We Can' really resonated with citizens because they needed hope,"" said Axelrod, who was wearing a 'We'll See' button that depicts a subdued President Obama weighing two options, both of which, Axelrod confirmed, are less than ideal. ""'I Have Big Ideas But We'll See How It Goes' resonates because people have been beaten down and know they shouldn't get their hopes up in terms of the country improving."", Many pundits have already condemned the new slogan, saying that while its language may capture the spirit of the political moment, its rhetoric is too optimistic., ""On the one hand, the slogan works because it avoids using overly presumptive words like 'win,' 'tomorrow,' 'future,' or 'better,'"" Politico's chief White House correspondent Mike Allen said. ""But using a phrase like 'We'll See' is also misleading, because it implies there is a slight possibility that something could happen. Unfortunately, voters need to realize that, at this point, nothing they could ever envision for the future—and I seriously mean nothing—has any chance of ever becoming a reality.""]"

But the other day, as I was running around on the playground, a thought suddenly occurred to me, a horrible realization that stopped me dead in my tracks: There are people out there who want to kill my dad. My dad. The man who is raising me, who asks me how school is every day, who takes me to soccer games and reads me stories when I can't fall asleep at night. People want to murder him. They want to murder my father., Doesn't really get more fucked up than that, now, does it?, When we first moved into the White House I was only 7 years old, too young to know that people wanted my dad dead. And I'll tell you what, I was a lot happier then. Now that I'm a little older, though, it's all becoming pretty clear. There aren't just four or five people who want my dad dead. Tons of people want to murder him. Tons. People in this country, people in other countries. The bottom line—and this is the cold, hard reality that I now fully understand—is that every second of every day, people are thinking of ways to kill the person I love and admire more than anyone in the world., Meanwhile, no one is plotting the murder of, say, my friend Amanda's dad. He's a computer technician. No one is trying to assassinate a computer technician. At no point in Amanda's day will she experience a rush of crippling panic due to the fact that, at any moment, a psycho wielding a semiautomatic weapon could step out of the shadows and unload an entire clip into her father's chest, killing him right on the spot., That's just true. You can try to comfort me all you want, but you know damn well that's just a fact., Here's another awful thing I've finally started to understand: The chances of somebody killing my father are so high that there is an entire force of men and women whose singular responsibility is to prevent that from happening. These people are specially trained. They create intricate plans specifically designed to protect my father, because no matter where he goes, somebody in the area probably wants to kill him. And look, I'm not some naïve little girl anymore. I can get on the Internet. I can research American presidents. I know damn well the Secret Service doesn't always succeed. Ronald Reagan almost died, and he had a daughter just like me., Also, I know exactly who John F. Kennedy is now. And I know exactly what happened to him., So, as this was all starting to sink in—and I was pretty shocked, as you can probably imagine—it occurred to me that I have my own Secret Service detail, which means there are also people who want me dead. They want me, an 11-year-old little girl, dead. Same goes for my mom and big sister. I mean, shit, they want to kill my whole family., And you want to know what the worst part is? I have no idea where my dad is right now. I haven’t seen him all day. For all I know, he could be waving to a crowd of supporters at this very moment while some guy on a rooftop 2,000 feet away has his head in the scope of a high-powered rifle, just waiting for the perfect moment to splatter his brains all over the stage., Put yourself in my shoes for a second. Imagine you’re standing next to your dad, holding his hand and smiling, when all of a sudden a bullet pierces through his skull and drenches your sundress in blood., Seriously, do you have any idea how messed up that is?, And I’m not operating under the misconception that all these people are going to get caught someday or just eventually give up. The most depressing thing is this will be going on for the rest of my life. Twenty years from now, when I’m living far away and have kids of my own, I could get a call from my mom with the news that Dad is dead. That he was blown to bits by a bomb in his car, and that they just barely found enough charred remains to identify the body., Well, great. I'm glad I finally figured all that out. Here's to a wonderful life, Sasha. I guess I'll just go outside now and play without a goddamn care in the whole fucked-up world.]"

It also states that Mitt Romney paid former school teacher John Mark Karr to falsely come forward as the murderer, and accuses the former Massachusetts governor of being a sex offender., Over a silhouette of Romney walking away from the Ramsey mansion—blood dripping from his hands—the commercial’s narrator asks, “If Mitt Romney kept the murder of JonBenét a secret from the American people, what else is he hiding?”, Moreover, at the end of the spot a smiling Romney is seen at a campaign event saying, “I killed her, and I had a good time.” Sources from the Romney campaign were quick to announce that the audio and video had been cobbled together from different statements he made during that particular rally., “Personally, if I killed JonBenét Ramsey, I would have come clean and told the American people that on day one,” Obama’s communication director David Axelrod said on Sunday’s installment of Meet The Press. “But I think that’s a key difference between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Barack Obama never murdered a child, and Mitt Romney did.”, According to sources at Obama’s Chicago headquarters, the “He Did It” commercial is just the first in a new series of attack ads that accuses Romney of drowning actress Natalie Wood in 1981, convincing cult leader David Koresh to burn down the Branch Davidian ranch in Waco, TX, and causing the Challenger disaster., “I think these ads will end up being very effective,” former Bill Clinton campaign strategist Dick Morris said. “If you are an undecided voter and you are constantly seeing images of Mitt Romney standing over a child’s lifeless body, or, as in the case of the ‘Zodiac’ spot, shooting two high schoolers at point blank range on their first date, that’s a pretty persuasive image right there.”, Added Morris, “This ad very effectively reminds us that no child murderer has ever been elected into the White House.”, Though the Obama campaign has denied it, many Beltway observers have said the advertisements are retaliation for the Romney camp’s highly controversial ad, “Boom,” which accuses the president of being the fertilizer bomb that destroyed an Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.]"

","September 4, 2012",Opinion,,,,,"[Good evening, everyone. Thank you so much for being here with us. I speak to you tonight as a mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister, and, of course, a proud American., But most of all, I’m happy to stand before you as a meticulously calculated communication tool whose every action, from the color of my dress down to each wave of my hand, has been premeditated and painstakingly devised by a set of experienced political handlers working to re-elect my husband this November., Honestly, I’m thrilled to see all of you here tonight, knowing that my presence has been consciously engineered to soften my husband’s image and give his poll numbers a quick boost. There is really no greater pleasure in the world than getting up on this stage and talking to millions of Americans not only as a first lady, but also as a cynical ploy to add warmth, humanity, and relatability to an otherwise cold, detached three-day display of political gamesmanship., It is also an honor to tell you, in words that were written out for me by a speechwriter and then carefully reviewed and edited by dozens of ruthlessly single-minded campaign advisers, all about how my husband is a caring husband and loving father, and how, in spite of his incredibly busy schedule, he is still so devoted to our family. A moment like this is such a great chance to reveal painstakingly scripted anecdotes about how he still picks up the girls from soccer practice and how I’m always nagging him to take the trash out so that you will believe he is an everyday person like you and your friends and not a massively powerful world leader with a superhuman degree of ambition and political savvy., After all, there are very real issues facing our country, and I’m proud to be forced to repeat some hackneyed political rhetoric that will go down much easier because it is coming out of my mouth, and to tell you about how much my husband loves these great United States and how he has met a series of challenges that you will indeed believe he has met because I seem trustworthy and not like some Washington insider who is just trying to get your vote, even though that is precisely what I am., It’s also a true honor to have my gender exploited in order to gain support among the key demographic of female voters, who I am forced to pander to by talking about my own relatable experiences as a woman. I’m honored to have my motherhood put on full display as a tug on the heartstrings of other moms around the country, and to talk about how difficult it is to raise a family and how I understand all the struggles that working mothers face in this day and age, as though that has even the slightest relation to my husband’s ability to lead this country out of an insecure economic landscape and tackle complex debates over health care, Social Security, tax reform, and foreign policy, among other things., And furthermore, it feels wonderful to be paraded out here, mascotlike, as an African-American woman, allowing my husband to appeal to both minority voters and women simultaneously, a rare feat which no other person in this campaign is able to carry out with such efficacy and which, again, I am so, so happy to do., Lest we forget, I hasten to add what a privilege it is to be objectified by all of you here and the millions of people watching at home, as I’m forced to use my charming smile and physical attractiveness to distract an entire nation from what is, by most accounts, a generally disappointing presidency. I can’t begin to convey what a dream it is to be used as a puppet by the hordes of political playmakers who direct my husband’s campaign, and to stand here in a shameless attempt to appeal to voters who like how I carry myself as a strong, independent-minded woman and love the picturesque image of our seemingly ideal American family., Needless to say, I am also overjoyed to have our two young daughters repeatedly roped into participating in this sick little dog and pony show., If all goes to plan, after I walk off this stage, you will see my husband not only as a strong political leader, but also as an everyday man who is trustworthy, honest, compassionate, and all the other bullshit you’d expect to hear from someone being used exclusively as a totem for some uplifting and calculatedly inspiring political message. And you have no idea how proud that makes me., Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.]"

","September 6, 2012",Politics,Politicians,War For The White House,Barack Obama,Our Annual Year 2012,"[CHARLOTTE, NC—The first family has turned more than a few heads at this week’s Democratic National Convention, where the president, as he greets delegates and waves to crowds of supporters, is often accompanied not only by his wife and two daughters, but also his rarely seen 19-year-old son, Luther., The shy, slightly overweight teenager, who has lived his entire life with his mother in central Illinois, seldom appears in public with the president, with whom he has reportedly shared a somewhat distant and occasionally strained relationship., “When I saw that kid with President Obama, I had no clue who he was,” said Georgia delegate Kathy Tyson, stating that the teen appeared to have difficulty sustaining eye contact with others and stood uncomfortably alongside his father when he shook hands with voters Thursday. “I guess he does kind of look like the president, though a bit shorter and stockier.”, Luther was born in 1993 to Andrea Pletcher, then a 24-year-old diner cashier whom Obama, a young law professor at the time, met during a brief trip to the state capital of Springfield. While the president’s son is said to have faced numerous obstacles during his childhood, including academic troubles, repeated emotional outbursts, and his mother’s bouts with alcoholism, family friends have stated that overall he was a “good kid” who “genuinely meant well.”, White House aides said the president sends money to Pletcher each month for Luther’s care. After he became a U.S. senator and moved to Washington, Obama reportedly visited his 11-year-old son every other Saturday afternoon, playing wiffle ball with him or taking him out to a movie matinee and then dinner at the local Applebee’s., When he became president, however, Obama’s contact with the boy reduced markedly, though sources confirmed he would still send Luther a birthday card and speak with him on the phone every month or so, often talking him through his schoolwork or asking about his son’s interests in music and online gaming., According to reports, the two have often struggled to find common ground, owing largely to their sharply differing levels of motivation and expectations for academic and personal success., “There was a rough patch during Luther’s early and mid-teens when he and his dad didn’t get along at all,” said Pletcher, speaking from the $600-a-month ground-level condominium she shares with her son and live-in boyfriend. “But Barry came to Luther’s high school graduation last year, and that was a big step forward for them. And now that Luther’s rebellious phase seems to be winding down, there’s definitely a greater respect between them.”, “I’ll tell you, though, Luther was a real handful for a while there, with his ADD and all,” Pletcher continued. “But he’s doing okay now. And I’ve been with [boyfriend] Ian [Williams] for the past three years, so Luther’s had a male figure he can look up to a little bit.”, In a sign of their improving relationship, Obama is said to have congratulated his son heartily upon learning Luther was giving school another shot this fall, enrolling part-time at Lincoln Land Community College. Additionally, Obama expressed optimism that his son could have a “real bright future” in the field of sales or, if he applied himself, computers., With Luther now slated to join the first family on the campaign trail, staffers confirmed the president has encouraged them to entrust the frequently expressionless teen, who often dresses in all-black clothing, with some minor tasks to help him learn about responsibility., “We’ve got Luther stuffing envelopes and handing out pins to the delegates, and he’s doing a great job,” senior campaign aide Stephanie Cutter said. “It takes a while for him to come out of his shell, but once he opens up he’s a real nice kid. Plus he’s just so great with Sasha and Malia. They really love their half-brother.”, “Luther may not have his father’s smarts or gift for rhetoric,” Cutter added, “but he tries. And he’s got a good heart—a real good heart.”, Despite comments that interactions between the president and his son have remained noticeably stiff and awkward, Obama said he was excited that he and Luther were spending quality time together and “finally starting to get to know each other.”, “I can’t say I was the perfect father by any means,” said Obama, admitting candidly that he “wasn’t always there for Luther.” “While my son has battled his share of problems, his mother really did the best she could raising him, and I think she did a fine job. Now Luther and I are ready to move forward and make up for lost time.”  “I’m real proud of my boy,” he added, putting his arm around his son, who flinched ever so slightly at the physical contact., ]"

","September 6, 2012",Politics,Politicians,War For The White House,Barack Obama,,"[CHARLOTTE, NC—With the savage roar of the heathen Democratic horde rising all around him, President Barack Obama delivered an incendiary speech to close his party’s national convention Thursday night, commanding the ultraprogressive minions in attendance to help him “destroy Jesus and usher in a new age of liberal darkness that shall reign o’er the earth for a thousand years.”, The thunderous 45-minute address—during which the president argued for a second term so that he could “finally kill Jesus once and for all, as well as all those who worship him”—was well received by the frenzied, wild-eyed audience, whose piercing chants of “Four more years!” and “Slaughter the believers!” echoed throughout the Time Warner Cable Arena., “My fellow Americans and godless infidels, I command you to join me as we cast an endless pall of far-left evil across the hills and valleys of our nation!” Obama bellowed from the stage, as thousands in attendance moaned in compliance and gyrated their hips and groins in a lascivious dance. “Together, as a barbarian people forged by the wicked flames of irreligiosity and united by visions of a liberal dystopia, we will rise up as one to scorch the earth with boundless amorality.”, “The streets shall run red with the blood of forced sodomy, performed daily upon every American man, woman, and child!” the commander-in-chief shouted, froth forming around his mouth as the crowd threw hundreds of aborted fetuses onto the stage. “Die, Christians, die!”, Slamming his fists on the lectern until his hands began to bleed, Obama proceeded to lay out a “three-point plan of sin and lechery” for his second term. If reelected, the president said, he would begin by banning organized religion entirely—starting with Christianity—and burning all churches to the ground, preferably “with their wretched, Jesus-loving congregants still huddled inside like rats.”, As members of the audience violently tugged at their genitals and howled like sex-starved, atheist wolves, Obama stated that his administration would then seek to make free, taxpayer-funded abortions legal at any stage of pregnancy, even up to one full year after birth, in order to supply his newly created “federal stem-cell harvesting plants” with raw materials., In addition, the cackling president vowed to “end traditional marriage as we know it” by passing legislation that would allow only homosexuals to raise children, a longtime Democratic policy goal., “A glorious new age of sinister, unconstrained liberalism is dawning! Oh, dear Satan, I can feel it coursing through my veins at this very moment!” shrieked Obama, ripping off his shirt to reveal an ornate tattoo of a pentagram, with a different homosexual act positioned at each of the star’s five points. “Agnosticism, contempt for human life, and radical sexual experimentation shall rule the day! Any good, virtuous, family-values-oriented Christian Americans who seek to topple our magnificent liberal kingdom of eternal darkness will be powerless to stop us! We will crush them!”, Added Obama, “Thank you, may Satan reward you all, and may God tremble in fear at the United States of America!”, The president was then handed an unbaptized, orphaned newborn baby drenched in the blood of 666 slaughtered Christians, which he handed over to its new, gleefully squealing homosexual parents.]"

","October 2, 2012",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,,,"[EVERYWHERE IN SPACE-TIME SIMULTANEOUSLY—Attempting to appeal to the widest possible demographic base as Election Day draws near, President Obama made a surprise campaign stop Monday to visit an infinite series of alternate universes that vibrate on a hyperdimensional plane different from the three spatial dimensions observable in our own universe., Occupying an M-theory-postulated “brane,” or multidimensional “membrane,” of either 11 or 22 dimensions depending on the chirality of the observer, Obama urged any hypothetical sentient consciousnesses within that multiverse to vote for him in November, or in whatever analogous chronological period their version of space-time specifies as extant., “I come here today to stress the importance of finishing the work we’ve started and moving our political discourse forward,” said the president, his voice confident and assured despite its sound waves propagating in wildly divergent modes incompatibly different from that of his and our native universe, due to differences in the fundamental physical constants guiding the alternate existence in which he stood. “It’s time we talked about the issues that truly matter to voters, and not just to a select few.”, , “If we all work together, we can do this,” said Obama, maintaining his composure despite the fact that a “rippling” effect was causing concentric waveforms to appear in the surface of his podium as his hand inadvertently passed through it. “We can start building a better tomorrow.”, At times contracting in size to near Planck-length in the subatomic realm of quantum foam, and at other times seeming to hover alone in a vast empty expanse of macrocosmic scale, the president spoke on a variety of topics, defending his oft-attacked economic policies and stressing the importance of alternative energy development, even as the subjective reality of his own consciousness fluctuated randomly between differing mutually incompatible percept-states., As his physical form split in two, diverged along parallel but separate time streams, and veered into realms that cannot be expressed by any known mathematical formulations, Obama stayed firmly on message throughout his address, despite the massive cosmological forces unleashed by the contradicting realities constituting the event., Several times during the speech, a blaring sound was reportedly heard as the multiverse threatened to collapse due to the paradoxical impossibility of Obama and itself existing simultaneously in the same plane of reality., “This is a bold move on Obama’s part,” said pollster Gregory Shire, a three-dimensional occupant of the universe knowable through our own current conception of reality. “By reaching out to include regions of purely mathematical speculation unverifiable by observable phenomena, the president is showing greater coalition-building ambition than any politician in recent history. And I think this ambition will pay significant dividends come Election Day.”, Despite the apparent political value of the speech, some Democratic insiders expressed concern that he is leaving himself open to criticism by the many thinkers who view non-empirically-observable constructs such as the one he visited Monday to be fundamentally invalid. Other critics have noted that the president runs the risk of being crushed in universes where gravity is 10,000 times more powerful than in our own, and where all the matter in his physical makeup could at any moment be converted into powerful, condensed energy in a miniature “big bang” event that would hasten the destruction of every universe, including our own., Still, the president’s surprise visit to the M-theory-postulated multiverse has for the most part been met with considerable acclaim, with many hailing it as one of the stronger stump speeches of his campaign., “I will never stop fighting for the values and the policies that truly matter,” said Obama, who according to aides may be considering a potentially infinite number of campaign stops in additional multiverses­, all of which occupy alternate segments of the totality of possible realities and are continually splitting into different quantum branches of Hilbert space. “The era of politics as partisan gamesmanship must come to an end. We must all work together to accomplish this.”, After speaking for what may have been 15 minutes, five days, or no elapsed time at all, the president closed his hyperdimensional remarks by clutching his head, screaming “Aaaaaauuuuugggghhh!!” and suddenly finding himself back in the Oval Office five hours earlier than he left.]"

He noted that in particular he has focused on not being afraid to go on the offensive and on perfecting his body language, which he said would be “absolutely essential” for gaining the upper hand in the first contest between the candidates., Moreover, after months of being attacked on the campaign trail, Obama acknowledged he was looking forward to finally dispelling what he described as baseless allegations leveled against his administration, saying he would “relish the chance to set the record straight once and for all.”, In addition, sources confirmed Obama has eagerly awaited “this, the first of three debates,” so he can seize on the Romney campaign’s numerous gaffes and repeatedly draw attention to the GOP nominee’s shifting policies. Hoping to employ Romney’s own words against him, Obama said it was vital that he use his initial debate appearance to “drive home” the message that his opponent is unprincipled and out of touch., “Look, it’s the first debate, which many people would argue is the most important of them all, so I have a responsibility here to come out swinging and really set the pace for the next two matchups,” Obama said. “Now, Gov. Romney is also aware of just how important the first debate is, so we expect him to be on the attack. But now is my first chance to really show people I’m completely focused and not at all rusty, so expect a spirited discussion.”, Admitting a subpar performance on his part could give Romney a significant bump in the polls and critically shift the electoral landscape just weeks before Election Day, Obama vowed to approach the first debate very seriously. The president said he and his team had devised rebuttals to every possible Romney answer and were working on ways he could stay bold, aggressive, and on-message throughout the evening, adding that he did not want to take any chances in the first debate and be forced to rely on a rebound in the next two., Obama also told reporters he was fully aware that the first debate would be watched by as many as 70 million Americans, and that “this is the big one.”, “The bottom line is that I have a much stronger plan for middle-class families, I actually have consistent and detailed policies on the economy and the deficit, and I have proven myself to be strong on national security,” Obama said. “All I need to do in the first debate, really, is make this distinction to the American people, and then this first debate should pretty much seal my reelection.”, “Frankly, it’d be pretty embarrassing if I couldn’t pull that off,” Obama added.]"

When he raised his head, the president, now shaking and weeping, proceeded to deliver the shocking news., “I’d like to remind anyone who questions my commitment to national security that in the past four years, we’ve put al-Qaeda on its heels, we’ve brought Osama bin Laden to justice, and the country is now safer than…than…I’m sorry, I can’t do this anymore,” said Obama, his expression taking on a nervous, pained look that witnesses confirmed they had never before seen on the commander in chief’s face. “Listen, we never got him, okay? We never got bin Laden.”, “We’ve never even came close to killing him,” Obama continued as his breathing grew more rapid and tears began streaming down his face. “And we’re no closer to getting him today than we were when I first took office. The man’s a lunatic, and he’s still out there. I’m sorry. I’m so very, very sorry.”, The visibly panicked Obama told the worldwide debate audience that he truthfully “[doesn’t] know where the hell Bin Laden is” and that he could “literally be in this room for all I know.” As the audience sat in stunned silence, the president revealed that last May’s Navy SEAL mission to kill the world’s most wanted man was a complete intelligence and military failure, resulting in heavy U.S. casualties and the deaths of dozens of innocent Pakistani civilians., “There was a chance he was in that compound in Abbottabad, but a very slim one,” explained Obama, adding that while fabricated reports put the odds of finding bin Laden in Pakistan at 50-50, the chances were really more like 90-10. “But I gave the order anyway, because I wanted it, you know? I wanted to kill bin Laden so bad, because the economy wasn’t good and news out of Afghanistan was hurting my presidency. Everyone told me the mission would fail, but I still went through with it. It was just a family of four living in that compound, and the guy we thought was bin Laden was just some tall man with a beard whom we murdered in cold blood.”, “Remember when I addressed the nation and told everyone Osama bin Laden was dead? I knew he was alive that whole time,” said Obama, looking at no one in particular and, for the most part, speaking to himself while in what appeared to be a state of severe shock. “I fucked up. Jesus Christ, I fucked up bad. I’m in trouble. I’m in really big trouble.”, Wiping his eyes with his sleeve, Obama then admitted his administration went to extreme lengths to cover up the truth by completely fabricating DNA evidence; releasing the book No Easy Day, which was credited to a Navy SEAL who the president said never existed in the first place; and fully financing production of the upcoming Kathryn Bigelow film Zero Dark Thirty., “The reason we never showed you his body is because we never had it to begin with,” said Obama, his forlorn gaze fixed on the floor. “Trust me, if we had killed Osama bin Laden, we wouldn’t have just tossed his body in the ocean. We would have paraded it around the entire goddamn world.”, According to the president, the only reliable intelligence the government has on bin Laden is that he is currently planning dozens of new attacks on America and that he continues to lead al-Qaeda, which has now expanded to virtually every country on the planet. Obama also confirmed that the CIA is “incredibly confident” that the terrorist leader is coordinating bombings in every major U.S. city, with at least five potential attacks aimed at the Pentagon and the Golden Gate Bridge alone., In addition, Obama said that bin Laden was actually in New York City three months ago and visited the Empire State Building., The president then continued to confess other factual distortions from his administration, revealing that the death toll of American soldiers in Afghanistan is actually almost 8,000, the Iraq War is still going on and as bloody as ever, Iran is just weeks or possibly even days away from having a fully armed nuclear weapon, and the real national unemployment rate is hovering around 10.4 percent., “Words can never fully express the sorrow and regret I feel for giving you a false sense of closure,” the president said after turning to speak directly into the camera, his voice quivering. “To the families who lost loved ones in the attacks on 9/11: Osama bin Laden is alive, and he’s healthier than ever. He’ll probably live to 100. And to my wife, Michelle: I have engaged in multiple extramarital affairs.”, Following the debate, the Romney camp released a statement saying that “Gov. Romney is absolutely thrilled Osama bin Laden is still alive.”]"

","October 25, 2012",Opinion,,,,,"[Well, here we are. Less than two weeks left in my reelection bid, and the race is locked in a dead heat. Though I assumed it would be a somewhat close election, I guess I’d be lying if I said I thought that with 14 days to go I’d be in such a vulnerable position. Because, when it comes down to it, my opponent is Mitt Romney. I’m not exactly running against Dwight D. Eisenhower or Abraham Lincoln or even George H.W. Bush here, you know? I’m running against Mitt Romney—a guy who has made so many conflicting statements on so many different issues that the thought of losing to someone like that leaves me severely depressed, and makes me question if I’ve maybe wasted my entire life. Truth be told, if I do lose on Nov. 6, I think the odds are pretty good that I’ll kill myself., Yeah, I’ll definitely commit suicide if I lose the presidency to Mitt Romney., I think that would be the best, and even the healthiest, thing for me both personally and professionally. The prospect of welcoming President-elect Romney to the White House, or watching Mitt Romney take the oath of office, or continuing my life as a president, husband, and father who lost the most important position in the entire world to the guy who ran the Salt Lake City Olympics just doesn’t seem very appealing to me. In fact, it makes me wish I were dead., The question is: Do I even deserve to live if I can’t beat Mitt Romney? And I don’t think I do, really. That’s why I’ll more than likely be packing a little gun with me on election night. Because the sooner I can end it all, the less pain I’ll feel., I mean, wouldn’t you kill yourself if the U.S. population felt that Mitt Romney—a man who basically wrote off half the American population as entitled victims incapable of taking care of themselves—was a more viable leader than you? Wouldn’t you take your own life if a massive segment of the citizenry basically said, “You know what, you ended the war in Iraq, you passed health care reform, you saved the auto industry, you repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, you had 32 straight months of job creation, and you killed Osama bin Laden, but sorry, I’m going with Romney”?, Of course you would. Just reading that sentence makes me want to reach for my pen right now and jab myself in the throat over and over and over again. Hell, I considered killing myself last week when Colorado and Virginia suddenly became a toss up. The first African-American president in the history of the United States loses his reelection bid to none other than…Mitt Romney. Mitt fucking Romney. The only way I could look at myself in the mirror if that happened would be if there were a cocked shotgun lodged in my mouth., I hope you don’t think I’m overreacting. In fact, I think my attitude is just about right. Mitt Romney spent the past year blaming me for setting a withdrawal date for our troops to leave Afghanistan, but then in our last debate he not only set a withdrawal date himself, but picked one that was identical to mine—2014. Nobody seems to give a fuck about that. And that must mean nobody really gives a fuck about me. It’s like I’m living in the goddamn Twilight Zone and nothing I’ve done matters at all. Look, a world in which people believe Mitt Romney is a better communicator than me is a world I don’t want to live in. So that’s why I’ll either hang myself in the Lincoln Bedroom or slit my wrists right there in the middle of the Oval Office. I haven’t decided which yet., Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Michelle is totally fine with me killing myself. She’s all for it. In fact, she said she’ll probably kill herself too, because she doesn’t want to be the wife of someone who lost to Mitt Romney. I certainly can’t blame her for that. Actually, if once all the ballots are counted, it turns out that that spineless, weak-willed fuck wins the highest office in this land, I think my entire family might just gather in the Rose Garden, hold hands, take five cyanide pills—one for Bo—and go away forever., Mitt Romney makes me want to drive a scalding hot nail into my eyeball. He’s a piece of fucking dog shit who has done nothing in this world except figure out how to say things people want to hear in order to get what he wants. He’s a gutless cocksucker pig fuck., I want to be on the record saying that before I commit suicide., Thank you, and God bless America.]"

","November 1, 2012",Opinion,,,,,"[This year, the American people face one of the most stark and important elections of our time, with much at stake for average citizens and their families. Election Day is less than a week away, and with my campaign running neck-in-neck with Mitt Romney’s, I fully recognize this is probably not the ideal moment to introduce a controversial new proposal widely ignored in mainstream politics. But I can no longer stay quiet about an issue I believe in so firmly., My fellow Americans, it’s time to talk reparations., As you may know, the latest polls show the race in the swing states is tighter than ever, with many crucial voters still undecided. So I realize that forcing the nation into a discussion about atoning for an institution abolished a century and a half ago, and introducing a program to redistribute wealth to black Americans—either in cash, bonds, or via a series of property reallocations—is not the most intelligent move, strategically speaking. Still, I feel this is a discussion we must have., I know many people will try to stop me at the word “reparations”—indeed, my aides have strongly advised me not to bring up this subject at all, especially with Ohio’s pivotal 18 electoral votes still very much in play. Additionally, one could make a rather convincing argument that there are far more pressing issues to consider first, such as persistent unemployment, an ongoing war, a deteriorating infrastructure, climate change, the nuclear ambitions of hostile nations, a stagnant housing market, record deficits, campaign finance reform, and any number of other things the American people actually care about., But to everyone who says this is not the right time to talk about reparations, I ask you this: Is there ever a good time to talk about this subject? Believe me, it won’t get any easier to discuss, so let’s address this matter once and for all. We’ll all be happier when we’ve rolled up our sleeves, taken several billion dollars from white people and given it to blacks, and put this all behind us., Only then can we finally move forward., Now, Americans have grown accustomed to hearing a lot about jobs, Medicare, and national security in recent months, so I can understand that it will be confusing when I suddenly begin to speak exclusively about making up for this country’s past mistakes by exempting black people from paying all taxes. I know that using the last few days of my campaign to push for a comprehensive reparations plan will, at best, alienate voters and, at worst, incite frustration, disgust, and outright contempt toward me—not to mention irreversibly recast my presidential legacy., But I am a man of moral convictions, and I will not rest until African-Americans receive the fair monetary compensation they deserve. Plus hundreds of years of compounded interest., Let me assure you, this plan will be the centerpiece of my second term. If you cast your ballot for me, the next four years will be focused pretty much entirely on reparations. That’s my promise to you., Granted, surveys show the vast majority of citizens, including many African-Americans, do not consider this to be an issue worthy of discussion. In fact, my friends and family—even my own wife, who is descended from slaves—have repeatedly sat me down and said, “Barack, please don’t do this.” But the scars of slavery have not healed in this nation, and no matter how many times David Axelrod grabs me by the shoulders and says it is profoundly foolish even to mention this idea, let alone actively work toward it, I believe that in a republic that holds all men are created equal, we must confront this uncomfortable truth and make the appropriate cash payout to every black American, regardless of age, gender, education, criminal background, or income., I’m thinking $150,000 a person., I do not pursue this policy for my family’s personal gain, which will be considerable. Rather, I bring it up because it’s the right thing to do, and because I believe we cannot wait any longer on this matter—not even until after the election, which all forecasts currently show to be extremely close and which, no doubt, will tilt overwhelmingly in my opponent’s favor within hours of this announcement., So when you head to the polls on Nov. 6, know this: There is only one issue in this election. It may be divisive, but there is clearly a right and a wrong side to it. Do you want to choose the side of my opponent, who willfully ignores the largest stain on America’s history by refusing to even talk about this issue? Or do you want to right the wrongs of our past by contributing 10 percent of your paychecks over the next decade toward finally reimbursing black folks for all their ancestors sacrificed?, The choice is yours.]"

Shortly after 11:00 p.m. Eastern time, upon prevailing in the key battleground state of Ohio, major media outlets declared the thoroughly beaten man’s victory., An hour later, the triumphant defeated man took the stage in Chicago’s McCormick Place convention center to the cheers of more than 10,000 supporters., “It is at once a tremendous honor and profoundly humbling to stand again before my fellow citizens, having earned your trust for a second term,” said the crushed victor, who successfully carried the crucial swing states of Florida, Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, and Wisconsin and sadly forfeited whatever remaining shred of enthusiasm and passion once drove him. “But tonight is not my victory alone—it is also yours. It is a victory for hardworking folks who believe that millionaires should be held to the same rules they are, for students with dreams of college and a brighter future, and for the sick and uninsured who will finally receive the medical care they need.”, “Tonight is a victory for all those who recognize that the truest path to prosperity is through opportunity for all,” the utterly lost winner added., The successful candidate, whose mental and spiritual reserves were wiped out in a landslide, thanked his supporters for helping him secure a clear win that roundly trounced his overall sense of optimism and hope., The broken and shattered man also called on the nation to mend its rifts and urged fellow citizens to “never tire in [their] pursuit of progress.”, “While we celebrate tonight, we know that the challenges that lie ahead of us are even greater than the ones that lie behind,” the victorious man who just spent the past four years of his life being utterly beaten into submission said. “But the virtues instilled by our founders—strength, determination, and moral conviction—still run strong in America today.”, The defeated man’s three percentage point victory marked a strong rebound for his campaign, which saw a five-point lead in the national polls erased following a poor performance in the first presidential debate in early October. Over the ensuing weeks, however, the beleaguered husk of a person managed to revive his campaign, something he was unable to do with his will, motivation, or spirit., According to aides, the disheartened individual received a phone call from his Republican challenger this evening, in which the former Massachusetts governor is said to have graciously congratulated the beaten man on his victory., “My fellow Americans, together we can build a nation that our children and grandchildren will be proud to inherit,” the victorious failure continued. “So when they ask us if we stood up and seized the moment—if we left this great nation even stronger and more just than we found it—we can look them proudly in the eye and say, ‘Yes, we did.’”, The defeated man will begin his second term on Jan. 20, 2013, when he will again be triumphantly sworn in as president of a defeated nation.]"

It’s not a big deal—honestly, it’s really not at all—but it’s just something I’ve neglected to mention in the past, and now that I’ve been reelected, I think it’s time I just get it over with and tell people already: I collect antique Nazi memorabilia., Now, let me be clear about this: I myself am not a Nazi. This obviously should go without saying. Furthermore, I have no affiliation whatsoever with the National Socialist movement in any way other than being a collector of Nazi art and iconography. Needless to say, I am repulsed by Nazism’s abhorrent beliefs. The genocide that robbed six million Jews and millions of Poles, Roma, and gay people of their lives stands alone as a nightmare unique in mankind’s history, but aesthetically and culturally, yes, I do find it fascinating, and collecting Nazi memorabilia is a hobby that I enjoy in my spare time., I would also like to emphasize that this hobby, while not necessarily “common” on a large scale, does not make me weird or somehow deviant. Also, it’s more common than you might think. Check it out online. Besides, collecting Third Reich paraphernalia is merely a diversion I indulge in privately, or in the company of numerous fellow Nazi memorabilia collectors whose interest in this area is purely historical., People in this country are free to collect whatever they want to collect. It’s one of the things that makes America great, if you want to think about it that way., Also, a lot of presidents had quirky hobbies, you now. Teddy Roosevelt collected taxidermy. FDR collected stamps. I collect Nazi badges, insignia, and crockery. At the end of the day, whether it’s a stamp or a little vintage swastika pin, we’re just talking about little trinkets here. It’s not some huge deal. It’s not like I’m running a Nazi flag up the pole in front of the White House or something. Absolutely not. I keep my Nazi flag folded and stored in an antique pine case in my private residence., There are probably a few questions people have right away, the first one being, “Do you own or have you ever worn a Nazi uniform?” The answer is yes, I own several, including a windbreaker and cap from the Panzer Totenkopf division. However, I’d like to clarify that I almost never wear my Nazi regalia. In the rare instance that I do, it’s in my private living quarters and is not intended for anyone other than myself or the Third Reich memorabilia enthusiasts I occasionally invite to the White House for trunk shows and conventions., All of whom, I should add, are really nice, normal Americans with no Nazi-leaning sympathies., Second thing some of you may be wondering: Do I own a copy of Mein Kampf? Yes, I do. A first edition, in fact. Have I read it? Yes, I have. Now, I strongly disagree with it, but it’s an important historical document nonetheless, and I think people should be familiar with it on, you know, a historical level. Many scholars and academics have read Mein Kampf numerous times over and it’s considered totally normal when they do so, just to put things in perspective., And look, I understand if this bothers people. Many folks I know don’t understand my hobby. Michelle, for example, does not. And that’s fine! I don’t flaunt it in her face or anyone else’s face. That’s why I haven’t mentioned it until now. However, I also don’t want to seem as though I’m hiding it, because it’s not something to hide or be ashamed of. If people checked it out, they might actually find it kind of cool. Not “cool,” exactly, but, you know, interesting., I am not a Nazi., Okay, while I’m not sure this editorial went particularly well, I nevertheless encourage people to write to me with any questions or concerns they might have. I like to think that transparency and honesty are hallmarks of my administration, so this matter shouldn’t be handled any differently., Also, if anyone happens to have a lead on a 1936 chained SS dagger, I would be very interested to hear from them as well—I’m trying to complete a set.]"

Apparently unwilling to concern himself with any beliefs other than his own, Obama selfishly spoke without interruption, never once allowing another person to get a word in edgewise or offer a differing viewpoint., “Christ, that guy just wouldn’t stop talking,” said Lehigh, PA resident Ken Datillio, 41, who said he watched in mounting disbelief and annoyance as the self-involved leader kept going on and on, seemingly unaware of how profoundly egocentric he was being. “He talked, no joke, for 10 minutes straight about the economy. I thought that would be it, but then he started right in talking about energy for at least another five minutes—and that was just the start of it. It’s like this guy has a goddamned opinion on everything.”, “Have you listened to someone talk for 60 minutes straight?” Datillio added. “It’s excruciating.”, Millions across the country expressed amazement and aggravation at the sheer audacity displayed by Obama, noting that he paused only briefly during his lengthy and pompous monologue to allow the crowd to applaud what he was saying, behavior many likened to that of a small, emotionally needy child., Moreover, sources noted that Obama demanded to be broadcast on every major television network during primetime, evidently as some sort of self-important ploy to force as much of the population as he could to listen to him speak., “I was going to watch my favorite show, but this completely self-involved jerk just got on the TV and interrupted it,” said Charlene Washington of Kansas City, still irked that the one man’s selfish whims had upended the entire national television schedule. “And get this, he not only ruined my night with his unending, self-involved opinions, but he also made the Attorney General, the entire Supreme Court—all sorts of important people—just sit there quietly and listen to him speak like he was the only one in the room.”, “It’s one thing to say your piece for a minute or two, or maybe start a dialogue or something, but this guy just talked forever about whatever he wanted,” Washington continued. “When it was over, I looked at over at my husband and was like, ‘What the hell was that?’ Seriously, who does that?”, After finally finishing speaking, the utterly conceited man reportedly wandered into the very crowd he had just subjected to his lengthy oratory, apparently under the self-indulgent belief that such individuals would want to shake his hand or congratulate him on his hour-long, uninterrupted lecture., “Some people just think they’re so important,” said a shocked and annoyed Rep.

","February 27, 2013",Politics,Our Annual Year 2013,,,,"[WASHINGTON—With the dramatic, across-the-board sequestration scheduled to occur this week, the nation’s leading economists have warned that President Obama and Congress must come to a compromise on the budget by Mar. 1, and then again by Apr. 1, and then Apr. 20, Apr. 28, and—after Congress is once again unable to come to a comprehensive agreement to fully stabilize the economy—May 1, along with agreements twice a week, every week, for the next four years., Experts say that without reaching a deal this Friday, the automatic $85 billion reduction in government spending will immediately slow the U.S. economy and impact thousands of middle-class citizens. Officials said the same exact thing will happen next month, the month after that, and the month after that if Obama and Congress fail to meet deadlines created by the preceding, incomplete deals., “If the president and Congress are unable to reach a grand bargain by Mar. 1, what they will likely do is reach a set of 100 or so smaller bargains, all with their own deadlines, and all of which could potentially plunge the U.S. economy into a recession,” said Princeton economics professor Marshall Kahn. “So, the Mar. 1 deadline is absolutely crucial. Just like the one next month will be. And the 12 deadlines in May. And the bi-daily deadlines that will kick in during the summer.”, “Based on the way the president and Congress deal with one another,” Kahn added, “in 2014, there will need to be 4,562 budget deals.”, According to leading economists, should negotiations between Obama and lawmakers stall this week, Congress could vote on a resolution to extend the current deadline to May 1, which would likely cause vital cuts to public programs, and also combine the projected negotiations scheduled for May 30, June 4, June 5, July 8, 2014, and Mar. 12, 2042 into one seven-day-long meeting., Other experts noted that even in the event of a deal, a clause in the Budget Control Act would inevitably lead to a total of 64 additional meetings between June and July, as well as a potential deadline creation deadline that would automatically kick in on Oct. 4 and would create 20 more deadlines that must be agreed upon by a Nov. 5 deadline., “The fact is, lawmakers will need to deal with the scheduled automatic tax increases, which Republicans will challenge by calling for cuts to education and health programs like Medicare and Medicaid,” Wall Street Journal analyst Will Case said. “All of this will require 12 straight years of intense talks.”, “And then 15 more years of talks if they are unable to come to some sort of compromise,” Case added. “I don’t see an agreement happening at all before the final Sept. 4, 2342 deadline.”, In a statement to reporters today, Obama stressed the importance of Republicans and Democrats remaining willing to work together throughout the next crucial 70,844 days., “In order to avoid a drastic loss of many hardworking teachers, police officers, and hospital workers, we all need to go into Wednesday’s 378 meetings recognizing the strength of working together,” Obama said. “Whether we’re meeting tomorrow or three weeks from today or right this very second, which we are—this statement is actually part of a budget meeting I’m having—we need to go in with this spirit of compromise.”, At press time, talks between Obama and House majority leader John Boehner had broken down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 13,000 points.]"

","March 1, 2013",Politics,Barack Obama,Opinion,,,"[Well, here we are again. The nation is on the brink of a fiscal catastrophe, and the leaders of Congress and myself have repeatedly failed to reach a compromise. Sure, we’re going to try to avert this crisis with a series of tense negotiations, but the fact is, it’s come down to this: Either I have to murder John Boehner or he has to murder me., Plain and simple., I wish I could say there was some other way to deal with the current situation, but no matter how many times I go into a series of discussions with our Speaker of the House, all the while struggling to find even a shred of common ground between us, the answer just becomes more clear as each day passes. One of us has to kill the other. There’s no other way out of this.  It can either be me murdering him or him murdering me (though I’d prefer to live), but either way, one of us has to die  so the nation can finally move on from this constant fight over the budget., John completely agrees with me on this point. Just the other day we were in the Oval Office, once again going back and forth about our different views on tax cuts and the government’s long-term deficit for the umpteenth time, and I looked him dead in the eye and finally asked point-blank: “John, do you think one of us is going to have to murder the other?” He responded, “Yes, I think so,” and we both left the room., It was the easiest discussion we’ve ever had., We also have both Democrats and Republicans in unanimous agreement on this issue. Sure, for a while we thought it could all be resolved if either John or I knocked the other unconscious until after this deadline passed, or if we maybe just had Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell fight to the death on our behalf, or if we acted like adults and talked to one another, but we eventually realized that John and I are the key players here and this country isn’t big enough for the two of us. So hopefully I’ll murder him and that’ll be that. But if it ends up that he murders me first, well, then so be it., Look, I know you’re thinking to yourself that there must be some other solution to our problems. There is not. Trust me. The President of the United States or the Speaker of the House of Representatives has to be violently murdered in order for the United States government to move past its differences. Is it sad? Sure. Is it ideal that the nation will have to see one of its most respected leaders become a cold-blooded killer? Of course not. But, nonetheless, here we are., I mean, do any of you have a better idea? I sure don’t., Here are some ways I see this all happening. First, Boehner walks into the Oval Office expecting to see me at my desk, but I’m not there. Then I come from behind and smash his head in with the Abraham Lincoln bust and he collapses to the ground. Or maybe I disguise myself as a member of the House and, once Boehner calls a session to order, I run up and stab him 500 times.  Or maybe it’s just as simple as breaking into his home at night and smothering him to death with a pillow. I might have to kill his wife, too, but I’ll just chalk that up to collateral damage. I know it sounds brutal, but I’m sure he’s sitting in his office right now thinking of his own ideas for killing me., Perhaps we could just go out onto a field, run at each other with swords, and whoever dies, dies. That might be the fairest way to get this done and finally move forward. And it actually sounds kind of fun., So, just to give everyone a heads up: In a week or so, the U.S. populace will either be mourning the death of Barack Obama or the death of John Boehner. It’ll be sad at first, sure, but ultimately it’s a good thing. At least everyone will finally know where this country is headed., Nothing for nothing, but I’d like to strangle him with a piano wire while Eric Cantor is forced to watch.]"

That’s why Bo has agreed to a comprehensive aid package that includes thousands of tons of heartworm medicine and emergency Ken-L Rations.”, “It should just be a formality shepherding the relief bill through both doghouses of Congress,” Chiclets added., In addition to reaching an aid deal, the two leaders are said to have talked extensively about the ongoing situation in Arfghanistan, where Tailiban insurgents continue to commit heinous acts of terrierism and aggressively defend what they consider their territory. According to sources, Furuguayan officials pledged to deploy several hundred well-trained rovert ops soldiers along the Pugistan border to help multinational FIDO forces sniff out and put down the Muzzlem extremists., Additionally, both sides vowed to tighten treat sanctions on the disobedient nation of North Corgia., “Bo and Cesar believe we’ve been chasing our tails for far too long with North Corgia, and agree that it’s time to put our paw down on the matter,” Chiclets said. “We’ve tried waving a big stick in talks with the North Corgians, but they simply refuse to roll over. And we’ve also tried offering them a variety of rewards to bring them under the negotiating table, but to no avail. Listen, we’re not going to beg here.”, “They’re being bad,” Chiclets added. “Very, very bad.”, Following the busy day of negotiations and an exciting ride in the presidential motorcade, the Furuguayan representatives were treated to an extravagant state dinner that is said to have featured a variety of rawhide appetizers, a six-course meal of kibble, chow, and wet food, and a mouth-watering bone dessert, all served in gold-rimmed fine china bowls on the White House’s opulent East Room floor., According to the guest list, over 300 of the biggest figures in Woofington pawlitics attended the gala event to celebrate the countries’ renewed ties and sniff each other’s anal glands.

Apparently unwilling to concern himself with any beliefs other than his own, Obama selfishly spoke without interruption, never once allowing another person to get a word in edgewise or offer a differing viewpoint., “Christ, that guy just wouldn’t stop talking,” said Lehigh, PA resident Ken Datillio, 41, who said he watched in mounting disbelief and annoyance as the self-involved leader kept going on and on, seemingly unaware of how profoundly egocentric he was being. “He talked, no joke, for 10 minutes straight about the economy. I thought that would be it, but then he started right in talking about energy for at least another five minutes—and that was just the start of it. It’s like this guy has a goddamned opinion on everything.”, “Have you listened to someone talk for 60 minutes straight?” Datillio added. “It’s excruciating.”, Millions across the country expressed amazement and aggravation at the sheer audacity displayed by Obama, noting that he paused only briefly during his lengthy and pompous monologue to allow the crowd to applaud what he was saying, behavior many likened to that of a small, emotionally needy child., Moreover, sources noted that Obama demanded to be broadcast on every major television network during primetime, evidently as some sort of self-important ploy to force as much of the population as he could to listen to him speak., “I was going to watch my favorite show, but this completely self-involved jerk just got on the TV and interrupted it,” said Charlene Washington of Kansas City, still irked that the one man’s selfish whims had upended the entire national television schedule. “And get this, he not only ruined my night with his unending, self-involved opinions, but he also made the Attorney General, the entire Supreme Court—all sorts of important people—just sit there quietly and listen to him speak like he was the only one in the room.”, “It’s one thing to say your piece for a minute or two, or maybe start a dialogue or something, but this guy just talked forever about whatever he wanted,” Washington continued. “When it was over, I looked at over at my husband and was like, ‘What the hell was that?’ Seriously, who does that?”, After finally finishing speaking, the utterly conceited man reportedly wandered into the very crowd he had just subjected to his lengthy oratory, apparently under the self-indulgent belief that such individuals would want to shake his hand or congratulate him on his hour-long, uninterrupted lecture., “Some people just think they’re so important,” said a shocked and annoyed Rep.

","February 27, 2013",Politics,Our Annual Year 2013,,,,"[WASHINGTON—With the dramatic, across-the-board sequestration scheduled to occur this week, the nation’s leading economists have warned that President Obama and Congress must come to a compromise on the budget by Mar. 1, and then again by Apr. 1, and then Apr. 20, Apr. 28, and—after Congress is once again unable to come to a comprehensive agreement to fully stabilize the economy—May 1, along with agreements twice a week, every week, for the next four years., Experts say that without reaching a deal this Friday, the automatic $85 billion reduction in government spending will immediately slow the U.S. economy and impact thousands of middle-class citizens. Officials said the same exact thing will happen next month, the month after that, and the month after that if Obama and Congress fail to meet deadlines created by the preceding, incomplete deals., “If the president and Congress are unable to reach a grand bargain by Mar. 1, what they will likely do is reach a set of 100 or so smaller bargains, all with their own deadlines, and all of which could potentially plunge the U.S. economy into a recession,” said Princeton economics professor Marshall Kahn. “So, the Mar. 1 deadline is absolutely crucial. Just like the one next month will be. And the 12 deadlines in May. And the bi-daily deadlines that will kick in during the summer.”, “Based on the way the president and Congress deal with one another,” Kahn added, “in 2014, there will need to be 4,562 budget deals.”, According to leading economists, should negotiations between Obama and lawmakers stall this week, Congress could vote on a resolution to extend the current deadline to May 1, which would likely cause vital cuts to public programs, and also combine the projected negotiations scheduled for May 30, June 4, June 5, July 8, 2014, and Mar. 12, 2042 into one seven-day-long meeting., Other experts noted that even in the event of a deal, a clause in the Budget Control Act would inevitably lead to a total of 64 additional meetings between June and July, as well as a potential deadline creation deadline that would automatically kick in on Oct. 4 and would create 20 more deadlines that must be agreed upon by a Nov. 5 deadline., “The fact is, lawmakers will need to deal with the scheduled automatic tax increases, which Republicans will challenge by calling for cuts to education and health programs like Medicare and Medicaid,” Wall Street Journal analyst Will Case said. “All of this will require 12 straight years of intense talks.”, “And then 15 more years of talks if they are unable to come to some sort of compromise,” Case added. “I don’t see an agreement happening at all before the final Sept. 4, 2342 deadline.”, In a statement to reporters today, Obama stressed the importance of Republicans and Democrats remaining willing to work together throughout the next crucial 70,844 days., “In order to avoid a drastic loss of many hardworking teachers, police officers, and hospital workers, we all need to go into Wednesday’s 378 meetings recognizing the strength of working together,” Obama said. “Whether we’re meeting tomorrow or three weeks from today or right this very second, which we are—this statement is actually part of a budget meeting I’m having—we need to go in with this spirit of compromise.”, At press time, talks between Obama and House majority leader John Boehner had broken down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 13,000 points.]"

The nation is on the brink of a fiscal catastrophe, and the leaders of Congress and myself have repeatedly failed to reach a compromise. Sure, we’re going to try to avert this crisis with a series of tense negotiations, but the fact is, it’s come down to this: Either I have to murder John Boehner or he has to murder me., Plain and simple., I wish I could say there was some other way to deal with the current situation, but no matter how many times I go into a series of discussions with our Speaker of the House, all the while struggling to find even a shred of common ground between us, the answer just becomes more clear as each day passes. One of us has to kill the other. There’s no other way out of this.  It can either be me murdering him or him murdering me (though I’d prefer to live), but either way, one of us has to die  so the nation can finally move on from this constant fight over the budget., John completely agrees with me on this point. Just the other day we were in the Oval Office, once again going back and forth about our different views on tax cuts and the government’s long-term deficit for the umpteenth time, and I looked him dead in the eye and finally asked point-blank: “John, do you think one of us is going to have to murder the other?” He responded, “Yes, I think so,” and we both left the room., It was the easiest discussion we’ve ever had., We also have both Democrats and Republicans in unanimous agreement on this issue. Sure, for a while we thought it could all be resolved if either John or I knocked the other unconscious until after this deadline passed, or if we maybe just had Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell fight to the death on our behalf, or if we acted like adults and talked to one another, but we eventually realized that John and I are the key players here and this country isn’t big enough for the two of us. So hopefully I’ll murder him and that’ll be that. But if it ends up that he murders me first, well, then so be it., Look, I know you’re thinking to yourself that there must be some other solution to our problems. There is not. Trust me. The President of the United States or the Speaker of the House of Representatives has to be violently murdered in order for the United States government to move past its differences. Is it sad? Sure. Is it ideal that the nation will have to see one of its most respected leaders become a cold-blooded killer? Of course not. But, nonetheless, here we are., I mean, do any of you have a better idea? I sure don’t., Here are some ways I see this all happening. First, Boehner walks into the Oval Office expecting to see me at my desk, but I’m not there. Then I come from behind and smash his head in with the Abraham Lincoln bust and he collapses to the ground. Or maybe I disguise myself as a member of the House and, once Boehner calls a session to order, I run up and stab him 500 times.  Or maybe it’s just as simple as breaking into his home at night and smothering him to death with a pillow. I might have to kill his wife, too, but I’ll just chalk that up to collateral damage. I know it sounds brutal, but I’m sure he’s sitting in his office right now thinking of his own ideas for killing me., Perhaps we could just go out onto a field, run at each other with swords, and whoever dies, dies. That might be the fairest way to get this done and finally move forward. And it actually sounds kind of fun., So, just to give everyone a heads up: In a week or so, the U.S. populace will either be mourning the death of Barack Obama or the death of John Boehner. It’ll be sad at first, sure, but ultimately it’s a good thing. At least everyone will finally know where this country is headed., Nothing for nothing, but I’d like to strangle him with a piano wire while Eric Cantor is forced to watch.]"

Those big trucks you always see on the highway use hydraulically operated ramps to get all the cars on the back,” Obama told the assembled White House Press Corps. “What they do is, they have this one retractable ramp that actually comes down from the upper level, and that allows the driver to first load the bigger cars on top. Then they put it back up, and the smaller cars are driven directly into the lower section of the rig.”, “In some instances, the bottom level is divided into multiple platforms,” the president continued. “This enables the front of one car to be tilted so another one can be loaded under it, allowing more vehicles to ultimately fit in the truck.”, Noting that you can usually fit “eight or nine” cars on the backs of one of those big trucks, Obama went on to explain that the process of getting the cars off of the big truck is largely the same process as getting them onto the big truck, only in reverse., The president then confirmed that drivers can usually load an entire truck full of cars in about an hour, although with cars of different sizes the loading process can take considerably longer., “Okay, so this is where it gets a little complicated,” said Obama, in response to a question from Associated Press reporter Ben Feller about how they position a car on the very roof of the truck, directly on top of the driver, without having it fall forward onto the road. “As with all the vehicles on the trailer, heavy chains are used to secure that car in place. See, the majority of cars are built with these tie-down holes in their frames, and they use special hooks to fit those holes and ratchet the car firmly in place.”, “Each vehicle is secured at four locations, ensuring that they can’t move at all while the truck is driving,” Obama added. “Sometimes, instead of chains, they use these high-strength straps that tie to the car’s tires so it doesn’t get scratched.

Lauderdale to suffer a mass shooting, terrorist attack, or other unexpected tragedy, he and his team of writers would be hard-pressed to channel the city’s sandy beaches, wide streets, and abundance of strip malls into a resounding testament to the triumph of the human spirit., Moreover, Keenan emphasized that none of what most people associate with the city—warm weather and a large elderly population—would be in any way helpful when attempting to compose a speech designed to reassure and embolden a country reeling from a recent devastating event., “With Ft. Lauderdale, you’ve got palm trees, retirement homes, boat dealerships, a bunch of sunburned tourists, and that’s about it,” said Keenan, noting that few if any of these elements would be worth more than a line or two in any presidential address designed to urge listeners to overcome hardship and emerge stronger for it. “If we were to have Obama go up and talk about that for 30 minutes, it wouldn’t resonate with anyone, and it certainly wouldn’t make anyone feel particularly proud to be an American.”, “I mean, say the Fairfield Inn near the Ft. Lauderdale Airport gets bombed for some reason,” he continued. “I guess we could talk about America’s rich tradition of staying at airport hotels to reduce travel time in the morning. Or I suppose we could string together a narrative in which we talk about how the Fairfield served free continental breakfasts and that all Americans, as per tradition, certainly do enjoy their breakfast. I don’t think any of that would soothe and inspire a beleaguered nation, but it’s something.”, Fellow Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes concurred with Keenan’s assessment, pointing out that the city of 170,000 lacks any kind of cultural depth, inspiring local figures, or general relevance to the country’s larger history that could be incorporated into a speech intended to comfort and remind people of the nation’s greatness., Rhodes noted that he’s thought about putting something together about the determination of the area’s first settlers, the Tequesta Indians, but admitted that would be “quite a stretch.” He even thought about using luxury yachts as a theme, but told reporters that would probably only inspire the country’s rich boat owners., “With most cities, you’ve got this established notion of a resilient, tight-knit community that can surmount any and all obstacles,” Rhodes said, adding that if a devastating tragedy were to strike Chicago, San Francisco, or even Baltimore, he and his staff would be able to pull from the city’s distinct character and fire off a profound rumination on the power of the American dream “no problem.” “But with Ft. Lauderdale, what is there? Fireworks stands, drunk spring breakers, and the former home of Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas.”, “It is a 45-minute drive from West Palm Beach,” Rhodes added. “So, that’s a thing about Ft. Lauderdale.”, According to the speechwriting team, the one saving grace is that it’s highly unlikely that terrorists would ever target any of the city’s three T.G.I. Fridays locations or its many go-kart tracks., “I just can’t see us having to use Ft. Lauderdale as the embodiment of America’s resolve and dogged perseverance any time soon,” Rhodes said. “So, barring a freak explosion at the Ft. Lauderdale Antique Car Museum, Obama will more than likely not have to look directly into the camera while meditating on the greatness of the city and its overall relationship to the country.”, “Wait, I guess a lot of baseball teams do spring training in Ft. Lauderdale, right? So you have spring training, which leads to baseball, which is called America’s pastime, and ‘America’s pastime’ certainly has the word ‘America’ in it,” he added. “Yeah, we’ve got nothing.”]"

","May 16, 2013",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,Opinion,Editorial,"[This week, President Barack Obama and his administration have come under fire from political opponents seeking an explanation for the White House’s alleged complicity in a series of widely publicized scandals. Inquiries regarding the administration’s role in a cover-up of the Benghazi attack, the Justice Department’s tapping of AP journalists’ phone lines, and the supposed malfeasance by the Internal Revenue Service are innumerable and have succeeded in hijacking the 24-hour news cycle., However, in the midst of these colorful distractions, there looms a far greater intrigue that President Obama has steadfastly ignored. The Onion speaks, of course, of the questions surrounding the Basilisk Project. For months now, the Obama administration has chosen to maintain silence on the matter, evidently relying on the complacency of the nation’s so-called journalistic authorities to allow its machinations to remain out of both sight and mind., , But such secrecy will not be tolerated., As the vanguard of journalistic integrity and as the sole news source dedicated to uncovering the truth no matter the cost, The Onion now demands of you, President Obama, to explain the nature and purpose of the Basilisk Project, and to do so fully and without delay., You cannot hide the location of the freighters forever, Mr. President. You cannot continue to ignore the actions of the Belarusian consulate or fail to explain the nature of your relationship. Perhaps most importantly, you cannot pretend the gated compound outside Lynchburg, VA simply does not exist. We have confronted you on these and other matters in recent days, Mr. President. Your response? Not a word., And so the web does tangle., Perhaps our president hopes to escape the moral implications of having allowed the Basilisk Project to operate under his nose, believing that his hands are clean. Or perhaps Mr. Obama is hoping that the American people might actually believe he was somehow unaware of the Basilisk Project altogether. Then again, perhaps you, “President” Obama, are, indeed, the puppet here. Which begs the question: Just who is pulling your strings?, , And so, in hopes of bringing some kind of clarity to this ever-widening circle of madness, The Onion demands answers to the following queries:, What is the addendum to the Klim Report? And who authored it?, Who recorded the minutes during the infamous Vitebsk meeting?, What, damn you, is the status of Onion reporter Tomas Kovacs, with whom our Minsk bureau abruptly lost contact last month?, How do you account for the Treasury Department’s response?, Will you fire Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisers Alan Krueger?, As journalists, it is our duty to uncover the truth, whatever the personal risks. From what we know, the nature of the Basilisk Project is such that its uncovering is of vital importance to the immediate health and livelihoods of at least 287 Americans. Does the president believe that the lives of these 287 souls are expendable? That they can be swept under the rug, like so much shattered china? Is human life itself so worthless to you, Mr. President?, If our president truly cares about the responsibilities of his office, he must expose the Basilisk Project and do so immediately. And we here at The Onion pray that he will do just that. For should this vicious plot be allowed to remain hidden in the shadows, grinding to its devastating and all-too-sad conclusion, it may just be too late for us all.]"

So now, release yourselves from your attire and surrender your body and mind to the pleasures of the vita carnalis, and to the sheer majesty of the human flesh.”, “Do not resist,” the president continued. “Avail yourself of every journalist and cameraman in this room!”, According to reports, the six-hour-long alcohol-fueled orgy included nearly 50 reporters from a number of Pulitzer Prize–winning media outlets engaged in various sex acts. Multiple eyewitnesses confirmed seeing two AP reporters engaging in anal penetration against a lectern, an ABC News correspondent screaming in ecstasy as she was repeatedly penetrated with a live NPR microphone, and a naked secret service agent urinating on New York Times journalist Peter Baker., Eyewitness accounts confirmed that as the reporters continued ravenously copulating on top of one another, Obama ripped off his shirt, leaned back in a large golden chair, and was attended to by a bevy of 23-year-old political bloggers who eagerly satisfied his every sensual whim., Throughout the course of the lascivious ceremony, sources also reported seeing a fully nude White House press secretary Jay Carney prancing between the writhing, sweat-soaked nude bodies sprawled across the room while playing a pan flute and vigorously tugging his erect penis., “Are we not but beasts, each and every one of us?” Obama roared, as a line of young White House interns frantically playing drums filed into the room followed by servants carrying large trays loaded with slow-roasted boars, cooked turkeys, salted fish, and one large goat on a spit. “Death may visit us all by nightfall, thus do not concern yourself with the petty, ephemeral nature of existence and instead embrace pure pleasure!”, “I urge you, don’t stop until your most depraved fantasies are realized,” added Obama, while pouring a large cup of wine onto Mother Jones reporter David Corn as he licked honey from the president’s nipple., Reports confirmed that toward the end of the massive orgy, the swelling music quickly reached its apex as the dozens of heaving journalists growled with pleasure and edged towards climax. In the bacchanalian celebration’s final moments, a golden bust of a bull’s head was brought before the assembly, at which time Obama sliced the stomach of a USA Today political correspondent, spilling blood all across the briefing room., By the end of the orgy, multiple participants reported having no memory of the full span of the afternoon’s events due to the sheer volume and variety of alcohol and hallucinogenic black henbane consumed during the festivities., “When it began, I was admittedly apprehensive, but by the end I had become fully one with the ravenous sexual mammal that lives deep within my soul,” said NPR’s Ari Shapiro, who claimed to have had intercourse with somewhere between six and 32 different reporters throughout the event. “Honestly, I only remember flashes: a Newsweek reporter sitting on my face, me fisting Fox News’ Ed Henry, and lastly, me gaining consciousness again on top of a pile of CNN reporters.”, “It was the most marvelous experience of my life,” added Shapiro., At press time, the reporters, all covered in ejaculate, blood, fecal matter, and food, attempted to question Obama on the estimated timetable of the water resource development bill.]"

","June 18, 2013",Barack Obama,Opinion,,,,"[Leading the greatest country in the world is a demanding job for any one man or woman, and the responsibilities of a U.S. president, day in and day out, are at times profoundly stressful, as the past four years have taught me well. But I take great solace in the support of my family, my trusted advisors, and the fact that whenever the pressure seems unbearable, I can go be alone somewhere and just visualize myself back on the savannahs of western Kenya that I remember so well from my boyhood., I often feel overburdened by the strains of the Oval Office, but I draw great strength, confidence, and relief from my memories of that simpler time. Waking up with the sunrise, I’d help the village women forage or make clothing, and do my part to kindle the campfire. When I got older, I’d join the hunt with the men of the tribe—the day I speared my first eland and was proclaimed a man was the proudest achievement of my life prior to November of 2008., After a contentious showdown with Republican lawmakers, or amidst a looming controversy surrounding NSA surveillance, or following the release of a dismal round of approval ratings, I like nothing more than to shut it all out and think back to those long summer evenings that ended with freshly roasted meat, a few folktales from an elder, and then drifting lazily off to sleep right on the ground. Oh, how liberating it would be to go back to those times—the roughest part of my day might be a heavy rainfall or a mischievous patas monkey determined to steal a sweet potato., The ominous specter of North Korea’s nuclear program seems manageable while remembering those perfectly serene days when the work was finished early and my eight brothers and I would walk many miles west to swim and catch tilapia with our bare hands in the Great Water. Those were such innocent times, before I had any notion that my true calling was statesmanship on another continent, and before my decisions affected billions of lives and world history itself., Today, my job is fraught with treaties and wars, and the fates of countless people are at stake every day. I’d love to just decompress with a weekend back at the old grass hut. Camp David is nice and all, but it’ll never replace Luoland., You can take the kid out of Kenya, but you can’t take Kenya out of the kid, I suppose., Looking back, it’s kind of ironic, because being chief of the Luo tribe was not something that I ever dreamed about or even wanted to do. I liked hunting and skinning the beasts of prey, and I thought I’d get a healthy wife and a beautiful family that way, but I always believed that Wanyanga would be responsible for making all the important decisions in my life. Can you believe it—I mean in retrospect? That’s what makes me laugh most of the time: 30 people, no. But 315 million? Sure, what the hey!, And oh, the festival days! We Obamas would spend hours making feathered headdresses, then prance and chant with blind abandon. I still remember the dance I used to perform to thank Nyasaye for the splendor of nature, back before Christian missionaries taught me the ways of the White Man. I cherish those memories and seek comfort in them whenever I’m beset with questions over the IRS targeting of conservative groups, or actions surrounding the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi., Many have asked me, how did your life change so dramatically? Well, I was kind of rootless after Dad died, so I asked the village ajuoga what to do. He cast pebbles and, rather improbably, they came up saying I was destined to be president of the Harvard Law Review and then teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago. This was a lot for a young man to process, let alone live up to. But the pebbles don’t lie, so I wrapped some meager possessions in a wildebeest skin and set out for Nairobi., Almost a year later, I arrived in Boston, shoeless and speaking only a few crude English phrases. But the faculty of Harvard took pity on me, and soon no one was more surprised than I when I graduated with a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude. I believe old Onyango’s tales of Anansi the trickster god helped me to grasp the cunning subtleties of the U.S. legal system., I’ll be honest, though: When a professor was being unfair with me, a couple of Grandma’s voudon curses didn’t hurt., So here I stand, helming the greatest nation in the history of the world. True testament to the age-old American ideal that anyone can grow up to be president, no matter what you look like, where you come from, where your true loyalties lie, or what animal the gods of your ancestors resembled., But although I am a true success story of the fabled American Dream, I owe just as much to my beautiful wife Michelle for teaching me compassion, the English language, patience, and the fact that American women are not purchased from their fathers with gifts of cattle.]"

","July 19, 2013",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,Our Annual Year 2013,Breaking,"[WASHINGTON—Robert Linder, a miniature man who was among the closest and most trusted advisors to President Barack Obama and several past U.S. presidents, died of a heart attack this morning in his home within Obama’s ear canal. He was 83., Linder, who since 2007 has served as a personal counsel to Obama and resident of a 5-millimeter-tall house inside the right ear of the president, is best remembered for his key role within Obama’s successful 2008 campaign as well as his continued guidance to the administration on issues as varied as healthcare, the economy, and foreign policy., In a statement to the press today, Obama described Linder’s death as “a tremendous personal loss,” adding that he will “deeply miss the tiny man’s irreplaceable presence in [his] cabinet and inner ear.”, “When I decided to run for office, I knew I needed Bob by my side, and he has been with me every day since, as an advisor and a friend,” said Obama, adding that he could always rely on Linder to be “candid and straightforward on any issue.” “As most of you know, Bob lived right behind my eardrum, so he was always nearby and ready to provide clear advice on every decision I’ve made as president.”, , “No one worked more closely with me than Bob,” Obama continued. “He always had my attention.”, During Obama’s first term in office, the infinitesimal Linder was a constant presence inside the president’s external auditory canal, providing recommendations on ending the Iraq War, streamlining legal immigration, and implementing counterterrorism strategies., Linder, who was also instrumental in the passing of 2010’s Affordable Care Act, reportedly convinced Michigan representative Bart Stupak to support the bill after persistently lobbying the congressman for two months, at one point standing on the tip of Stupak’s nose and ordering him to get his caucus in line., While Linder mostly worked out of his very small office located right above Obama’s earlobe, several members of the administration issued personal statements today about their own experiences with the passionate, small man., “Bob was always willing to help anyone out and, honestly, he knew the issues better than anyone else on staff,” said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, who explained that Linder would, on rare occasions, jump from the president’s ear into Timothy Geithner’s ear when the Treasury Secretary introduced new fiscal policies. “Whenever we heard President Obama give an inspirational speech, we knew that 50 percent of it was written before and 50 percent was whispered off the cuff by Bob into Obama’s eardrum while he dangled from a hair follicle.”, Born in 1929 deep within the nasal cavity of a Nebraska pig farmer, Linder spent most of his young life in Omaha with his two small parents and four teeny siblings. During the Korean war, he served in the military inside the ear of a U.S. lieutenant,  receiving the Army’s Commendation Medal for valor., After the war, the ambitious, microscopic 24-year-old moved to Washington and quickly established himself as a political force while working in the orifices of various senators such as James E. Murray and Paul Douglas. By 1978, Linder was renowned in Congress for toiling in the jowls of Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill and soon accepted a role in the Oval Office as a trusted aide, constantly sitting on President Jimmy Carter’s eyebrow., In 1992, Linder received a senior advisor position in Bill Clinton’s administration, where he quickly formed a close personal and working relationship with the former president. Up to the time of his death, the miniscule advisor was known to keep in touch with Clinton and even maintained a summer home on the roof of the former president’s mouth., “Bob always had his own way of doing things and was always committed to the well-being of the country,” said Clinton, in a statement that expressed his “sadness at the loss of a close friend.” “Sometimes late into the night, long after I was asleep, Bob was still up working…I can still remember hearing his feet pacing up and down my sinus cavity into the early hours in the morning. He loved his job.”, “Honestly, every man would be better off having a guy like Bob living inside his head,” added Clinton., Robert Linder’s funeral service will be held Monday in Washington, D.C., when, according to the wishes stated in his will, his body will be placed in a 2-millimeter-long coffin, wrapped in the world’s smallest American flag, and laid to rest in the Capitol rotunda., The 83-year-old leaves behind his wife, Melinda, and a 3-millimeter-tall son who recently graduated from Cornell.]"

When he turned over the body to inspect it, however, he identified it as the Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Georgia peanut farmer., Obama said he wished he could be addressing the nation under different circumstances, and admitted that he is currently experiencing a severe case of shock., “I had the light, but I could have been paying better attention,” Obama said, a tear streaking down his face. “And that’s what kills me, you know? This was my fault. It was an accident but it was my fault. You take your eye off the road for a second, and…bam, you hit Jimmy Carter with your car. I’m actually sort of numb right now. Jimmy Carter is gone and I am the one responsible.”, “Why exactly President Carter was even carrying two bags of groceries in downtown Washington, D.C. when he lives in Georgia, I have no idea,” the president went on to say. “And why he was buying groceries at 2 a.m. we’ll never know. And perhaps I should stop going on my late-night drives to clear my head. But none of that matters now. I’m sorry about this. I am so, so sorry. Goddammit!”, The president went on to extend his sincerest apologies to former first lady Rosalynn Carter, saying that he would do anything to help in what he is sure must be a difficult time., Breaking down further and deviating from his prepared remarks, Obama told the country that if he could sign a bill that would bring Jimmy Carter back to life, he would. The president then noted that when you’re 88 years old the body just isn’t well equipped to handle blunt-force trauma, especially from a car going 40 mph., Gripping the podium with both hands, Obama then stared down at the ground, began breathing heavily, looked back into the camera as if he was about to continue speaking, and then started dry heaving., “I would have done anything—anything—to keep that man alive!” Obama said. “He looked up at me right before the very end. I’m not sure whether he realized it was me, or if at that moment he was thinking about—of all the people to hit him with a car—how strangely ironic and weird and bizarre that the president of the United States had hit him. I don’t know whether or not he was of sound mind to think about how he, too, had been president, and how there have only been 44 presidents, and how we usually travel by motorcade, and how this probably should have been avoided from an operational and statistical standpoint. But when he looked at me, there was no hate in his eyes.”, “He looked very peaceful,” Obama continued. “And then he just drifted away.”, James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr. was born Oct. 1, 1924 in Plains, Georgia. He was one of four children born to James Earl Carter and Bessie Lillian Gordy. He is survived by his wife, his brother “Billy,” three sons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons. He brokered the Camp David Accords in 1978, and is the only U.S. president whose death has been caused by the sitting president.]"

","August 20, 2013",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,,,"[WASHINGTON—Carefully jotting down notes as the two sat in his small second-floor office on K Street, psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Eccleson patiently let President Barack Obama angrily voice his complaints and grievances about every single American in the nation, sources confirmed Tuesday., While conceding that the president has “made some decent progress” over the course of several months of therapy, Eccleson told reporters that Obama still has many deep-seated issues with each of the 313 million members of the U.S. populace., “This week we continued exploring Barack’s resentment about being constantly judged by others,” said Eccleson, noting the president’s reliance on unhealthy defense mechanisms to distance himself emotionally from the American public. “Again and again I hear things like, ‘No matter how hard I try, nothing is ever good enough for Seattle resident Bryan Harrison.’ But I keep stressing that, at the end of the day, Barack is a human being and can’t expect himself to be perfect.”, “A lot of his feelings of inadequacy—thinking that no matter how successful he is, he can’t live up to people’s expectations—stem from his relationship with his father,” Eccleson continued. “That’s also at the core of his trust issues with not only Bryan, but also Gail Shaughnessy, Eric Corker, Amy Bergin, and more or less the entire population of Worcester, MA.”, Eccleson, who has been seeing the president weekly since April, said Obama spends much of his 45-minute sessions fretting over the lack of communication between himself and the nation’s citizenry. Obama was reportedly overheard claiming that Nebraskans such as Dorothy Perez, Clay Jones, Keith Uriahson, and Heather Conelly “don’t know what the hell they want,” and accused residents of Iowa, Ohio, and Michigan of “not even listening when [he’s] talking half the time.”, “Barack exhibits many of the classic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. For example, our talks often return to the aforementioned Bryan Harrison or the 47,000 residents of Santa Cruz County, AZ, who Barack says ‘always focus on my mistakes, but never give me credit for all the things I do well,’” said Eccleson. “So today I asked him how he defines success and failure, and after a few moments he admitted he’d never really thought about it before.”, “That was a big breakthrough,” Eccleson added., Obama was also reportedly adamant that millions of Americans constantly put him down in public “without even considering how that makes [him] feel,” and at one point during the session, sources confirmed that Obama sighed, shook his head, and quietly muttered, “I just hate them sometimes.”, “What I try to impress upon Barack is that it’s perfectly normal to get angry at other people,” Eccleson said. “That it’s completely fine, say, to disagree with the Peraldi family of Glynn, GA about health care reform. What’s not okay, though, is keeping those feelings pent up inside until they boil over.”, “We’re working on ways for Barack to express these emotions in a healthy, mature way,” Eccleson continued. “But it’s difficult, because he’s been harboring a lot of negativity toward southeast Georgians for a very, very long time.”, Eccleson confirmed he has been pleased with Obama’s improvement under a daily 100-milligram dosage of the antidepressant Zoloft, having recently taken the president off a combination therapy of Klonopin and Effexor due to the medications’ negative side effects., According to White House sources, prior to seeking out professional counseling, Obama had been suffering from semi-regular panic attacks, bouts of depression, and was prone to lashing out at friends and coworkers, especially when remembering the time Bryan Harrison criticized his stance on immigration as being “too soft.”, “It was challenging at first because Barack can become incredibly defensive when he’s wrong,” said Eccleson, citing instances where the president had furiously accused the entire middle class of holding him to unfair standards. “He tends to compartmentalize and then project his fears onto others. I just had to cut him off halfway through one of his rants earlier and ask, ‘Is the city of Cleveland to blame for stagnant unemployment and a dying manufacturing sector, or are you just blaming yourself?’”, “He has trouble taking responsibility at times,” Eccleson added. “Also, I don’t think Barack has ever fully come to terms with his biracial background.”, Though confident that the president will eventually overcome his issues with the American people, Eccleson admitted to reporters that Obama is “still a long way away” from resolving the litany of complex problems in his marriage.]"

","September 3, 2013",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,Syria,,"[WASHINGTON—As fierce debate continued this week over a proposed military strike on Syria, President Obama stressed to all Americans Monday that any U.S. involvement in the Middle Eastern country would not in any way mirror the 1456 Ottoman Siege of Belgrade., “I of course realize that many people around the country are concerned that an intervention in Syria would devolve into another Siege of Belgrade, but I can assure you that this operation will be swift, decisive, and will in no way resemble the Ottoman Empire’s ill-advised invasion of Nándorfehérvár,” Obama told the assembled White House Press Corps. “Our mission in Syria is fundamentally different from that of the Ottomans 550 years ago—there will be absolutely no boots on the ground, the attacks will only last for two or three days at the most, and we will, under no circumstances, be deploying a fleet of 200 galleys and 300 cannons.”, “I can promise you this: My administration and I will not repeat the mistakes of Sultan Mehmed II,” Obama continued. “Believe me, we have all learned the lessons from the campaign to subjugate the Kingdom of Hungary following the fall of Constantinople.”, Obama was reportedly adamant that the United States is not acting on poor or shortsighted intelligence, unlike the 15th-century Turks who underestimated the difficulty in quelling Belgrade’s peasant army. The president also claimed that the current situation in Syria, when closely examined, “barely resembles the fight against St. John of Capistrano and his crusaders when they breached the Ottoman camp.”, Despite the White House’s claims that an American intervention in Syria would, if anything, most likely resemble the Ottoman Empire’s successful 1521 Siege of Belgrade under Sultan Suleiman I, many remained skeptical this week that a U.S. military effort in Syria would not ultimately result in a military disaster on the scale of the 1456 campaign, which left extensive casualties of over 10,000 Hungarians and 50,000 Ottoman soldiers., “When I heard we were getting involved in Syria, right away I thought, ‘Well, here we go, it’s 1456 Belgrade all over again,’” said Seattle resident Matt Haggerty, 42, who, like millions of Americans, says he “in no way supports the idea” of getting entangled in any military campaign even remotely similar to the Ottoman invasion of the Catholic Balkans. “Look, we all know what happened in Belgrade: Mehmed II thought he had everything under control, but Hungarian nobleman John Hunyadi organized a peasant army of roughly 50,000 soldiers and relied on the strength of the city’s castle to breach the Ottoman’s formidable naval blockade, which prevented any further imperial advances into Europe for roughly 70 years. And frankly, like most of my friends and neighbors, I see very little separating what we’re about to do in Syria and what the Anatolian corps did during their all-out assault on the Belgrade fortress from the Danube River. ”, “I mean, sure, you can argue that the Ottomans eventually took Belgrade in the 16th century and held it successfully for 167 years, but there’s no question that the siege destabilized the empire for half a century,” Haggerty added., Those who support a unilateral American military strike, however, maintain that the aftermath of Belgrade should be kept separate from the discussion of Syria., “Regardless of the outcome, when you consider the circumstances and what people knew at the time, the Siege of Belgrade was the right thing to do, and I think the same about our responsibility to intervene in Syria,” said 38-year-old Paterson, NJ resident Ashley Holloway. “After all, Mehmed II was only doing what he thought was in the best interests of the Turkish people, and he genuinely believed that the 1456 siege would ultimately offer the greatest chance of stability to what was unquestionably a troubled region. I trust that Obama, who is no doubt just as conscious of the lessons of Belgrade as the rest of us, will act accordingly.”, “In the end, we simply can’t afford to do nothing,” Holloway added. “Otherwise, we’ll be left with the blood of another Kankali genocide in Bukhara on our hands.”]"

Also, anything you can do to dissuade people from purchasing or otherwise procuring a gun, knife, explosive, or other deadly weapon would be greatly appreciated. I think we can all agree that is a fair and sensible thing to do, right?”, “Right?” the president asked again. “Folks, c’mon now. Let’s settle down and have a conversation here.”, In the hours since the meeting, political experts have called the White House’s efforts to reach an agreement with the schizophrenic voices “an unequivocal failure,” with many suggesting the president never managed to adequately appease the concerns of the irrational and angry voices and may have even driven them closer to the brink of violence., “Every time it seemed like the president was making some headway on, say, gun control or a call for peace, the voices would quickly introduce a new, largely unrelated issue such as God’s desire for blood or the need to let the darkness seep out,” said Washington Post political analyst Mark Copeland, adding that at one point the voices all simply shrieked for a full 15 minutes. “It’s clear that most of the voices never trusted Obama or the government. By the end of it, some of them were even shouting for Obama’s death. Needless to say, this was not a political victory for the president.”, At press time, a representative for the nation’s displaced schizophrenic voices told reporters that the time for action is now, something must be done, and there can be no more delaying.]"

How can you not get behind that?”, “And Medicare has nothing to do with this, by the way—that’s a separate thing,” continued Seaver, adding one of the few remaining facts he knows about Obamacare. “This just deals with the private insurance companies and makes sure they can’t, you know, drive up costs through the roof.”, According to reports, Seaver mounted an impressive case given his severely limited knowledge of the actual law itself, bolstering his 8 percent understanding of the Affordable Care Act with his 6 percent awareness of the nation’s current economic landscape. Crawford, meanwhile, demonstrated just about the full extent of his understanding of Obamacare by claiming that its provisions could potentially kill jobs., Sources confirmed that, if asked, neither man would actually be able to correctly define the term “HMO” or coherently explain what a health care exchange actually is and how such a thing would actually work on a regional basis., “If you get insurance through your job, you can keep it, so this won’t affect a lot of people,” said Seaver, failing to incorporate roughly 90 percent of the bill’s actual groundwork into his semi-accurate assertion. “It’ll really only change things for really poor people who live below the poverty line. That’s it.”, “Saying this is somehow a government takeover of the healthcare industry is, quite frankly, a flat-out lie,” added Seaver, forcefully and passionately summarizing what he remembers from an informed person’s opinion he read on a website recently. “All this does is offer a public option.”, Over the course of the next half hour, the two men used their full comprehension of what reportedly amounts to several sentences at best of the Affordable Care Act to debate many facets of the 906-page piece of legislation. On separate occasions, sources said Seaver and Crawford both claimed to have done “a lot of research” on the subject., “Okay, I hear your points, but I think there are a lot of other factors to consider,” said Crawford, boldly countering Seaver’s 8 percent knowledge of the subject with his own 5 percent familiarity with it. “It’s actually going to raise insurance costs for most people. The way it actually works is, see, there are different tiers. And these different tiers, or levels or whatever, have different co-payments. And then there’s the individual mandate, which means you’re required by law to get insurance, otherwise you pay higher taxes. So, you see, there are all these other things to think about.”, “Are you starting to get it?” Crawford added, after almost completely emptying his accumulated knowledge on the subject in one fell swoop. “It’s complicated, for sure.”, The two men, whose collective net understanding reportedly makes up, in a generous estimate, little more than one one-tenth of the entire Affordable Care Act, then repeatedly volleyed back and forth over the constitutionality of the law—a matter that sources confirmed they have a roughly 0.000001 percent knowledge of., Sources also confirmed that the two men independently opted not to introduce at all the subjects of prescription drugs, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the law’s effect on small business owners, exemptions, state costs, specific penalties for opting out, effects on the marketplace, the nation’s existing overall quality of health care, any specific statistic whatsoever, and the federal budget., “Hold on, Alex, let’s go back to the premiums for a second, because I feel like I need to drive this point home for you: they’ll get lower for most people,” said Seaver, straining the very limits of his 8 percent comprehension of the bill to the point of utter collapse. “Lower premiums, lower deductibles, and no denial of coverage to people with preexisting conditions.”, “Way lower premiums,” Seaver added., At press time, both men’s understanding of Obamacare had dropped to 3 percent as a result of the debate.]"

The hour is nigh.”, While some political analysts argued the surprise announcement suggests a weakening in resolve of the faction, opening the door for further movement on their stance, several Republican staffers have already indicated that the caucus will not negotiate on their declared terms and that any attempts to substitute Sasha for Malia will be fruitless., “It must be Malia,” stated Mick Mulvaney (R-SC). “First of birth. First of blood. First of the reckoning.”, Experts added that in addition to limiting the damage of the current government shutdown, the deal could also avoid a protracted and dangerous battle over raising the nation’s debt ceiling in the coming weeks if members of the Tea Party determine Malia has fulfilled the prophecy., “The Tea Party has spoken,” said Georgetown professor of political science Richard Drape. “The deal has been wrought. All bear witness to the fruits of the Great Compromise, for it is with us.”, At press time, a teary-eyed Michelle Obama was informing Malia that she will always love her.]"

","October 7, 2013",Politics,Politicians,,,,"[WASHINGTON—Stating that he had been informed of “a certain problem that needs solving,” a high-powered Washington fixer reportedly entered the White House at 11:35 p.m. Wednesday and told a blood-spattered President Obama to listen to what he said and listen very carefully., “I’m here to help, Mr. President, but if we’re going to get you out of this mess in one piece, you need to do exactly what I tell you to do,” the gruff 58-year-old fixer is said to have told Obama as the president sat muttering to himself and staring at the blood on his hands. “So shut the fuck up and listen. The guy in charge right now is me and me alone. Got it?”, “Now, show me where it happened,” he added, slipping on a pair of latex gloves., The fixer, who wore a black suit and tie and carried a briefcase, pulled up to the White House in a black 1973 Oldsmobile, an anonymous source said, arriving exactly 20 minutes after he was contacted by an unknown individual within the executive residence., Conducting himself in a curt but professional manner, the fixer reportedly instructed a shocked and trembling Obama to break his cell phone in half, scrubbed every trace of bodily fluids and human tissues from the carpet in the Lincoln Bedroom, and then placed the chief executive’s watch and other personal effects into a Ziploc bag for disposal., “Go into the bathroom, strip off your clothes, and take a shower right now,” the fixer said as he eyed the president’s bloodied dress shirt. “When you get out, you’ll find a change of clothes hanging on the door. You need to do this immediately, do you understand me?”, “Say it,” the fixer added, curtly. “Say you understand me.”, According to sources, the fixer repeatedly pressed Obama for precise details, including the president’s exact whereabouts during the night, whether the screams would have been audible in the hallway, if anyone had seen the president entering or exiting the premises, and why there was a single blood-flecked molar resting on an ornately carved Victorian table purchased in 1861 by Mary Todd Lincoln., “Listen to me—listen to me,” the fixer said as the wide-eyed Nobel Peace Prize winner stared blankly at a framed copy of the Constitution on the wall of his private sitting room. “Is there anything else you’re not telling me? Anything at all? I don’t want any fucking surprises here.”, Over the course of his 45-minute visit, the fixer reportedly doctored numerous entries in the White House visitors log, contacted a handful of acquaintances who “know how to get certain things done,” and made several discreet trips out the South Portico to place bulging heavy-duty plastic bags in his trunk., Sources indicated the fixer also intensively coached Obama on how to respond if questioned by authorities, emphasizing that once he left, the president would not be able to see him or get in touch with him., “Here’s your story: You were working on climate policy in the White House Library with [U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest] Moniz—now, don’t worry, he’ll play along,” the fixer said as he ripped down the president’s blood-caked shower curtain. “At exactly 9:25 p.m., you went for a walk in the Rose Garden to clear your head, and, this is very important, you did it alone. Are you following me?”, Reports confirmed that after Obama nodded in the affirmative, the fixer made the president repeat the whole story back to him., At one point, when the fixer asked, “Does [First Lady Michelle Obama] know?” the president reportedly became so overwhelmed he began to sob., “Hey...hey!” said the fixer, slapping Obama across the face and telling him to pull it together. “You think you’re the first president I’ve had to deal with? Listen, if you lose your head right now, you are through—you understand me? You’ll lose all of this. Your position. Your family. Everything. You want the entire nation to see you on cable news being dragged across the White House lawn in cuffs?”, “Because if that’s the case, Mr. President, I can leave right now,” the fixer added. “No? Then get in the fucking shower, pronto.”, Though the fixer’s identity remains a mystery, at press time sources had confirmed he was an “old buddy” of Vice President Joseph Biden.]"

","October 9, 2013",Politicians,Sex,Lifestyle,,,"[WASHINGTON—Sitting down for a candid interview with Marie Claire magazine last Thursday, First Lady Michelle Obama reportedly opened up about her marriage to President Barack Obama, saying that their sex life “has never been more open, more experimental, or more generous.”, The first lady spoke at length with Marie Claire about the couple’s resurgent love life, revealing that after years of humdrum intimacy, a recent spike in the frequency and intensity of their lovemaking has resulted in the most satisfying and adventurous sex she has ever known., “We’ve never been this talkative in bed,” the first lady said, adding that the couple has recently enjoyed a “raw hunger for each other” that’s amounted to “some of the most intense—desperate, even—sex [she’s] ever had.” “We’d been treading water for a while there, just going through the motions, but then something clicked. We just started having fun with it. Sometimes I’ll leave my heels on, and other times I’ll come out of the shower and Barack will be already lying in bed, naked.”, “We have this new rule right now—we’re not saying ‘I love you’ during sex,” Obama continued, explaining that there’s a freedom that comes with treating intercourse not like two lovers, but like two strangers who just want to “have a little fun.” “And it doesn’t have to be a big production every time. Sometimes we’ll just do oral, or we’ll only use our hands. Anything that breaks the routine.”, The first lady said that prior to attending the G20 Conference in Russia last month, President Obama suggested that they try role playing, an idea that sent the couple into a midlife sexual odyssey that included experimentation with sex toys, domination, submission play, and on one “admittedly boozy occasion,” the intimate company of a senior White House staffer., “We’ve started playing around with choking,” the nation’s 51st first lady told Marie Claire. “And if it gets too rough, I just tell him to slow down. Slow can be really good.”, According to Obama, the couple fell into a rut during the president’s 2008 presidential run, when the stresses of the campaign turned the once passionate couple into roommates rather than lovers., Obama said that while the two never stopped having sex, intercourse became stale, almost like a chore. And while both the president and the first lady were still having orgasms, the predictability of the sex wasn’t giving the first couple the kind of satisfaction they both craved., “The thing is, Barack was always extremely sexual,” said Obama, sharing an anecdote when—while living in Chicago—they once found a private place in Jackson Park and had sex under a blanket. “But it was like we decided that the book was closed. We quit checking in, we let go of trying to make our sexual goals happen. For example, it had been a long time since I had a vaginal orgasm, and that used to be something that was really important to Barack—for me to get there.”, “Somewhere along the line we let that dream die, as well as the holy grail of having a simultaneous orgasm,” Obama continued. “That was upsetting. I remember I actually stopped masturbating for a while, because I started to feel like a less sexual, less desired person altogether.”, Obama noted that as a lover, the president is now 100% available emotionally, physically, and spiritually, and that he’s never been more attentive or celebratory of her body. In addition, the first lady confirmed that the president is going down on her more and that she loves it., “We’ve been watching a lot of porn together, too, which is also a big turn-on,” Obama said. “I really like James Deen’s stuff, and fantasizing about my favorite scenes helps me get over the edge when I’m close. I don’t come every time, that’s just how it’s always been with me, but Barack’s learning not to take it out on himself when I don’t have an orgasm.”, Considering their packed schedules and grueling travel itineraries, coupled with raising two teenage daughters, the first lady said “daytime quickies in the Situation Room or the Oval are a lifesaver” and that finding out-of-the-bedroom locations has been a fun, erotic challenge., “I surprised him on Marine One before he left for Sweden the other day, just to spice things up,” Obama said, adding that she gave him a little taste of what he’d be missing while he was gone by slipping her panties into his pocket before takeoff. “We use our time apart to rev up our engines. Barack knows I like to be bossed around, so before he went to Europe for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership a few months ago, he said I wasn’t allowed to touch myself until he got back. That was really hot. And during this government shutdown he’s been using me as a release, and sometimes being used in bed—being treated like an object—is really sexy, you know?”, “Marriage is a marathon, not a sprint,” Obama added. “We’re riding a high right now, and I know it’ll dip again. That’s okay. That’s how it works. But for right now, I’m just enjoying this flood of hot, hungry sex with my husband.”]"

Spooktacular is once again back from the dead to terrify and scare-ify each and every citizen,” said the president, as the sound of rattling chains and disembodied screams emanated behind him. “Every single citizen, both living and deceased, is invited to Witchington, D.C. for a night of 1,776 frights. Join us on Capitol Chill, if you dare, for a sinister celebration of creepy crawlitics and representative demonocracy.”, “Whether you’re a Deadocrat or a corpservative, you are assured a ghoulishly good time,” he added before cackling maniacally. “Tickets are $12 online or $15 in person. Bleh!”, The yearly festival, which runs for the nine days leading up to Halloween, features lantern-guided tours from government officials dressed as one of the nation’s putrefying Festering Fathers, and includes dozens of activities for children, including bobbing for apples in the Reflecting Pool and a contest to guess the number of candy corns packed inside the Washington Monument. In addition to viewing the 535 terrifying jack-o’-lanterns on the Capitol steps that are carved in the likenesses of all sitting congressmen, visitors can reportedly take hair-raising hayrides along the Potomac, which is dyed blood red, or have their picture taken in front of the Supreme Corpse., Sources confirmed that the attractions along the so-called National Maul will remain open until midnight throughout the Spooktacular, allowing patrons to enjoy the grisly, moonlit exhibits at the Jefferson Mummyorial, The Smithsonian Mental Institution, and the National Ghoulery, which boasts ghastly postmortem portraits of the nation’s 44 cadavers-in-chief., The most popular attraction, according to sources, is the Capitol Punishment exhibit at the Lincoln Memorial, in which the iconic seated statue of the 16th president is adorned with restraints on its wrists and ankles as well as a large metal electrode on its head that shoots sparks and emits smoke every half hour to the delight of onlookers., “I’ve been helping to put on the Haunted House of Representatives since I was first elected in 1987, and I have to say, I think I have just as much fun as the kids do,” said self-proclaimed U.S. Representative Nancy Decompelosi while applying several fake lesions to her face and adding plastic spiders to her hair. “We jump out at the tour groups from both sides of the aisle, show them to a live meeting of the Wails and Moans Committee, and then, when they least expect it, the Shrieker of the House bursts out of his casket and delivers a long, terrifying chillibuster. And for the older kids, we have the gruesome Senate Torture Chamber, where they can watch as the sadistic Majority and Minority Whips viciously gut and kill a helpless bill right there on the floor.”, “And on the way out we have all the kids put their hand into a bowl of cold spaghetti and tell them it’s John F. Kennedy’s brain,” she added. “That really grosses them out.”, Sources noted that the festivities extend beyond the city limits to Arlington, VA, where patrons can visit the Pentagram, which this year will reportedly feature a constantly circling swarm of spooky Predator drones painted to look like bats. As in years past, Arlington National Cemetery is likely to be among the Spooktacular’s biggest draws, with workers once again erecting thousands of temporary tombstones with rhyming epitaphs and adorning the grounds with fake limbs emerging from the earth. Additionally, visitors can gather to hear ghost stories every 20 minutes at the Tomb of the Undead Soldier, where for the past 30 years John McCain has lurched out from behind the monument at the very climax of each skin-crawling tale, typically resulting in dozens of visitors screaming, fleeing, and even fainting in terror., According to many visitors, though, the highlight of the D.C. Spooktacular remains a guided tour of the Fright House at 1600 Transylvania Avenue., “It was really fun when Press Secreterror Jay Carnage led us through that creepy old mansion and told us all about the Executioner branch of government,” said 8-year-old Logan Zaffino, dressed in a Wolverine costume, shortly after emerging from the Fright House. “The spookiest part was going through the Evil Office. I got so scared when Count Obama came out and gave his State of the Boo-nion Address.”, “It was kind of a rip-off at the end, though,” Zaffino added. “I thought they’d give us Kit Kats or Snickers or something, but the lady who lives there was just handing out apples.”]"

Between the Green Room, the Red Room, the Blue Room, and the East Room, we’ve got some of the White House’s most sumptuous interiors ahead of us. However, before we move on to the next room, I thought you folks might enjoy something very special today. Now, this isn’t something we usually do on these tours, but folks, what do ya say we go tickle the president?, Sound good? Okay, follow me right this way, ladies and gentlemen, and we’ll catch the President of the United States completely unawares and give him the ol’ tickle treatment. Boy, you folks are really in for a treat today., If you’ll kindly step over the velvet rope and through this back doorway, we’ll continue on to the West Wing corridor. Be very quiet now. As you all know, this leads to the Oval Office and the president’s private study, where he can often be found working quietly away from the public eye. That’s where we’ll burst in, tackle him to the ground, overpower him with physical force, and tickle him under his arms., Once again, I just want to reiterate at this juncture that kicking open the door to the president’s private office, throwing him to the ground, stifling his screams, and tickling him senseless isn’t something we usually do on White House tours. In fact, I don’t think it’s ever been done before. But you know what? I like you guys. You guys are a great group, and why not make this wonderful tour even more special, am I right?, Oh, and you two in the back? You’re the two biggest, so I’m going to need you to volunteer to hold the president’s arms because he’s probably going to start flailing around pretty bad., Now, if you’ll all do me the honor of crouching down here and following me through the door on the left, we’ll be almost inside the Oval Office. Let’s try to use our whisper voices from here on out, okay? Great. Once we’re inside the Oval Office, assuming we’re not taken down by Secret Service first, we’re going to need to bolt the door firmly behind us. Uh, miss? In the red sweater? Would you be willing to do that for us? Thank you so much., Also, when we enter the room, note the antique Resolute desk the president will be sitting behind. It was a gift to former president Rutherford B. Hayes from Queen Victoria herself!, One more thing: Folks, before we charge into the Oval Office, seal all exits, wrestle the president to the ground, and tickle him until such time as he is rescued, I just want to remind you all not to be discouraged if he doesn’t laugh at first, or in fact seems highly alarmed and completely unamused. Remember, the president is, as you can imagine, a very busy man, and we’ll be breaking into an area completely off-limits to the public, pinning him down, and repeatedly rubbing sensitive parts of his body, so he likely won’t be able to warmly greet each one of you individually. In fact, he will likely be trying to physically ward you off in a fit of panic and terror., But don’t let that stop you all from tickling him with all your might! Seriously, folks, do not stop tickling him until such time as you are forcibly removed from him or shot. Those who make it out of the room alive are welcome to escape into the Rose Garden where you will almost certainly be taken down by snipers, whom you’ll notice positioned at each corner of the White House roof. If you’re curious, be sure to turn around while you’re running and get a glimpse of them before they take aim., Well, ladies and gentlemen, we’re almost ready to go. As you’ve all no doubt noticed, I’m literally shaking with excitement right now. I’ve sweat through my shirt, in fact. Folks, you are witnessing the last few minutes of my career here.

She starts to take off her shirt, but before you know it, we’ve been joined by every American citizen from all 50 United States and they’re all taking off their clothes.”, “It’s like the third time I’ve had this dream in the last month,” he continued., According to Obama, his persistent sex dreams always feature the president engaging in elaborate yet somewhat indistinct carnal acts with the entire country, including actress Diane Lane, the entire population of the Pacific Northwest, poet Maya Angelou, the board of trustees of General Mills, the town of Blanco, TX, the starting five of the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx, and Philadelphia grocery clerk Michael Bailey., As explained by the commander-in-chief, the recurring fantasies invariably consist of an unending string of sexual encounters with each and every one of his constituents—including residents of the Great Lakes region, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, and the membership of the AFL-CIO—with the scenarios routinely skirting conventional logic as Obama hazily makes love to hundreds of millions of his fellow Americans., “At one point we’re all somehow in my old bedroom in Chicago—I don’t know how we got there—and I’m hooking up with [Jonesboro, AR resident] Deborah Aponte and the nation’s autoworkers,” Obama said, his breath quickening as he described erotic episodes that also included extended bouts of sex with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, an attractive female jogger he saw running past the White House earlier in the week, and Nebraska. “Then Debbie asks me if I want to take a bath, just the two of us, so then we’re naked in the tub. But I look up and the entire city of Houston is just standing there watching us.”, “And then the full faculty and student body of the University of Iowa walks in the room,” Obama added., The president noted that while many of the participants in his nocturnal sex romp remain “a little fuzzy,” he can still recall several of the more prominent role-players, including journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin and Westchester County, as well as a general mixture of celebrities and public figures whom he has been attracted to in the past, familiar voting districts, and states and cities he hasn’t thought about in years., Obama emphasized that he has never consciously thought about the majority of the American people in a sexual context while he is awake., “I remember there was this one part where we were all outside in what looked like an apple orchard or something and I was in this wild orgy with [Baltimore graphic designer] Patricia Desmond, [Transportation Secretary] Anthony Foxx, and the country’s hispanic population,” said Obama, admitting that he can’t quite recall if he was receiving oral sex from his old college girlfriend or the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. “And then I noticed that my wife and [Chicago alderman] Michael Zalewski were making out with each other and they invited me to join in.”, “That part was weird,” the president added., While Obama admitted that the frequency of his sex dreams involving himself and the nation has lately been uncommonly high, with the president claiming that he’s had dozens of such dreams ever since he was elected to his first term, the commander-in-chief told reporters that he saw nothing particularly unusual about his ongoing fantasies., “Everyone has dreams like these from time to time, so I don’t think it’s anything to worry about,” Obama said, adding that he used to have similarly sex-charged dreams about the entire citizenry of Illinois when he was serving as the state’s junior senator. “The mind works in strange ways, and I’m sure that there’s just some weird part of my subconscious that lusts after every single one of the people whom I govern over that manifests itself in these crazy, sexy dreams. So it’s no big deal.”, “And they’re definitely way better than those fucked-up nightmares I keep having about the entire population of Croatia,” Obama continued.]"

Can anyone hear me? I’m Barack Obama, President of the United States of America! I need to get out of here!”, “Oh, dear God, there has to be a way out,” continued Obama, ducking as several lines of text guaranteeing coverage for preexisting conditions flew just inches above his head. “There has to be.”, According to reports, Obama has spent the last few hours stranded in a dark, seemingly infinite three-dimensional insurance matrix made entirely of programming code, scrolling ones and zeroes, and indecipherable information about government subsidies, and has as yet been unable to locate a safe exit from the digital infrastructure of healthcare.gov itself., White House sources have confirmed that Obama is both alone and intensely frightened, and that the president may at this moment be endangered by the complicated, twisting data fields of healthcare.gov, as well as the terabytes of random eligibility notifications and policy cost estimations shooting in all directions., Further reports have warned that any hope of extracting the president from the online marketplace may already be lost., “This isn’t right,” said Obama, staring as enrollment information for millions of Americans was sucked into a growing cone-shaped vacuum in the middle of the healthcare.gov dimensional plane. “Why is it doing this?”, “The mainframe,” the president quickly added as hundreds of policy cancellations erupted from the swirling vortex. “I need to get to the health care exchange mainframe.”, Reports confirmed that after finally forcing his way past the dense clusters of programming language tangled in the healthcare.gov help page, Obama finally reached a complicated system of virtual pipelines sending information about spouses and dependents directly into a pulsating golden orb. Upon reaching his hand into the orb, the president was said to be transported directly into the heart of healthcare.gov’s online marketplace., Obama was then reportedly horrified to find himself inside a crumbling software framework, surrounded by a chaotic array of randomly scattered premiums, out-of-pocket charges, and collapsed open enrollment architecture., “Goddammit, I don’t know what to do!” Obama said, banging his hands in frustration against a wall of binary as the entire healthcare.gov mainframe suddenly froze, forcing all previously flowing lines of code to come to a complete standstill. “I can’t fix this! Get me out of this place!”, “Please! Just get me out of here!” Obama added as the data grid below his feet shattered into millions of infinitesimal pixels and he plummeted into an infinite void of lost health care coverage., At press time, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had assured reporters that engineers are working around the clock to free the president from the healthcare.gov site by the beginning of December.]"

But as the conflict continues to worsen, it becomes increasingly evident that the deployment of our armed forces may be our only real option.”, , “We cannot stand idly by and allow this senseless mayhem to continue,” the president continued., According to international observers, the United States Capitol ranks as among the most turbulent and unstable regions in the world, dominated by warring factions of rogue lawmakers who have shown neither the ability nor the willingness to peacefully resolve their differences., As conditions worsen by the day, the president confirmed to reporters that he and his military advisors are currently evaluating the merits of a military option, suggesting that his administration has left open the possibility of toppling the hostile, unpredictable leadership currently reigning over the legislative assembly and restoring order to the Capitol building., “Our efforts at resolving this conflict through conventional, non-military means have not only failed but seemingly emboldened extremists in the region,” said Obama, noting that while the United States does have some allies on the ground within the Senate, the administration has been almost completely cut off from the House for some time. “Right now there are millions of people who are hopelessly trapped under Congress’ corrupt rule, and it’s doubtful we’ll see any kind of progress in the area without either military intervention or a full-scale revolution, which is unlikely.”, , While the White House continues to explore the use of armed forces in Congress, some military experts have expressed doubts as to the prospects of such an operation, saying that a full-scale invasion of the Capitol building represents a costly and uncertain venture that could hamstring the U.S. for the foreseeable future., “We may have to accept the fact that the deep fissures afflicting Congress are, at present, unfixable, and that we’ll just have to wait the half-century or so it could take for the legislative body to achieve some kind of stability naturally from within,” said retired U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Harley, adding that the deep divisions affecting Congress may in fact be endemic to the entire Washington region. “We are seeing similar levels of chaos and infighting in the Supreme Court and in many of the smaller cities and towns where extremists loyal to members of Congress have gained significant ground. Are we really prepared to risk American lives for what could be a lost cause?”, “Besides, the majority of the American people are barely even aware of what’s going on over there,” Harley added.]"

","January 28, 2014",Politics,Politicians,Government,Barack Obama,,"[WASHINGTON—Saying that the time was right to come to terms with a difficult and enduring chapter in America’s history, President Obama admitted during his State of the Union address Tuesday night that the United States “just hasn’t been the same” since the death of music legend Buddy Holly., After beginning his speech by touting several political and economic accomplishments realized during his most recent year in office, a wistful and visibly saddened Obama abruptly turned his attention to the death of Buddy Holly, spending the majority of the speech discussing the brighter, better years prior to the 22-year-old rock and roll pioneer’s sudden passing in a plane crash in 1959, and repeatedly stating that America would “likely never again see” such simple, prosperous times again., “Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens: In the one year since my reelection, more Americans have found jobs, our new health care system has delivered coverage to millions of previously uninsured individuals, and we have moved closer to our goal of energy independence,” said Obama before pausing and growing reflective. “But regardless of all these achievements, it’s time that we as a country recognize that things just haven’t been the same—in many ways, haven’t been right—since that dark February day when America was robbed of Buddy Holly.”, “What we lost on that day was so much more than a rock and roll musician—we lost our innocence, we lost our youth, we all lost a little bit of ourselves,” Obama continued, adding that Buddy Holly’s rare mix of talent, vision, and youthful vitality just hasn’t been seen in America for decades and almost certainly never again would be. “And of course, this all goes without mentioning the deaths of Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper—two more stars whose extinguishing from the firmament left our nation a little darker.”, Throughout the 75-minute speech, Obama discussed all three of Holly’s studio albums along with his numerous posthumously released recordings, noting that the death of the musician forever changed every aspect of America, instilling a grave sadness in the heart of the nation that remains to this very day., According to the president, no advancements in science, no research and development subsidies, nor even any increase in arts funding could ever bring such a beloved icon back, and no government project of any kind could compare to the simple joy of witnessing “someone like Buddy—someone so gifted, so full of life—go up on stage with his Stratocaster and do what he does best.”, “When we talk about Buddy Holly, we’re really talking about a star with a once-in-a-lifetime brilliance who will never be replicated,” Obama said, noting that artists like Elvis Presley or even The Beatles could never fully heal the nation or restore the purity of American life that existed before Holly’s death. “Let’s face it: Buddy Holly changed America. In many ways, he defined and embodied America. And I’m talking about much more than what songs like ‘That’ll Be The Day’ did for rock music. I’m talking about his attitude, his presence—I'm talking about that feeling you get when you listen to wild, unbridled music and hold your girl close.”, “Do you know what I mean?” Obama then added, looking over his shoulders for a nod of approval from House Speaker John Boehner and Vice President Joe Biden., Bypassing the traditional State of the Union format of laying out his political plans for the following year, Obama spent nearly a full 15 minutes reciting the lyrics to Holly’s 1957 single “Everyday,” pausing every few moments to let the words sink in, and explaining how the unforgettable song symbolized a more hopeful time for America., “Of course, those Americans who were alive during Buddy Holly’s lifetime know exactly what it was like to be transported by a song made up of just a few simple chords that nevertheless manage to convey a feeling of unbounded brightness, optimism, and splendor,” said Obama, looking across the gathered assembly. “The tragic reality is that no one will ever get to experience that feeling again. And no matter what accomplishments we achieve as a nation, as a people united in a common purpose, we can never regain that lost joy and purity we once took for granted.”, “My fellow Americans, if we’re being truly honest with ourselves, I think we can all admit one thing,” Obama continued. “While the state of the union may be strong, it would have been a hundred times stronger if Buddy were still with us.”]"

","March 12, 2014",Politicians,Barack Obama,Our Annual Year 2014,Lifestyle,,"[WASHINGTON—Taking his time to thoroughly clean a pair of replacement carburetors and install them on a turbocharged Rotax engine as classic rock tracks blared from a nearby transistor radio, sources confirmed that President Barack Obama spent most of Wednesday afternoon in the White House garage continuing his restoration of a vintage military drone., Pausing every so often to admire his work, the president, dressed in jeans and a grease-stained Champion sweatshirt, explained that he has been tinkering with the 1995 RQ-1 Predator since acquiring it from a military scrapyard two years ago. The commander-in-chief said he considers the salvaged unmanned aerial vehicle a prized find, as the United States only produced 12 of the classic airframes for their inaugural deployment in the Bosnian War., “Now this baby right here is 1,300 pounds of pure American muscle,” Obama said as he tossed a socket wrench aside and wiped the oil from his hands. “From the single rudder steering to the inverted V-tail at the back, it’s all classic General Atomics engineering. Real beaut, isn’t she?”, “I mean, look at this pretty little antenna dome,” he continued, buffing the drone’s satellite communication housing with a shammy cloth. “They just don’t make UAVs like this anymore.”, After popping the cap off of a fresh Rolling Rock, the 44th president of the United States explained that in an effort to maintain its mid-’90s authenticity, he is rebuilding the craft using mostly original RQ-1 parts ordered either directly from the manufacturer or traded with other collectors online. The head of state added that he has come to prefer the latter, saying that it provides him an opportunity to meet and talk shop with fellow “drone-heads.”, “When I’m done, she’s gonna have all the bells and whistles of the original; I’m talking Moving Target Indicator, APX-100 Friend-Or-Foe transponder, heat sensor, laser designator—the whole enchilada,” Obama said, standing next to a faded poster from the 1994 Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. “And, if I can pick one up on the cheap, I’m hoping to put in a top-of-the-line GPS, too.”, “With a set of souped-up avionics like that, you can really open her up once you hit international airspace,” he continued., The president, who confirmed that he planned on sanding down the tail the next time he has a free weekend, said that after installing custom titanium wing linings, his next project will be to apply a coat of gunmetal gray paint to the vehicle’s body in order to get “that timeless Predator look.”, Obama later mentioned, however, that he hasn’t completely ruled out one day upgrading the paint job to pure white or even MARPAT desert camouflage, which he claimed would “turn a few heads” and make the shell’s classified carbon-Kevlar composite “really pop.”, “Of course some of these mods aren’t exactly regulation,” the sitting president said with a wink, referring to the set of AGM 114-Hellfire missiles his friend, a retired Air Force weapons specialist he would only identify as “Spud,” helped him install last fall. “I also stripped off her Synthetic Aperture Radar to compensate for the added weight, which just means you have to be a little more careful when the weather’s bad.”, “These old Predators are highly temperamental, so you’ve got to know how to treat ’em right,” he continued, adding that he wouldn’t dream of running one with anything less than a 50-50 blend of JP-8 and Syntroleum jet fuel. “Normally people can only get these things to do about 135 at a max altitude of 25,000 feet, but with a little TLC I’ll bet I can juice her up to at least a buck fifty-five, buck sixty.”, Obama boasted that the finished work would harken back to the “glory days” of drones, when he says American ingenuity dominated the skies over the Balkans. Noting that back in that era Predators were the drone of choice for Operation Nomad Vigil, the nation’s chief executive reflected on the machines’ superior handling and reconnaissance capabilities, lamenting that today’s newer models with their “flashy AN/AAS-52 Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems” seem only to be focused on precision strikes against high-value terrorist targets., The two-term president told reporters he does not intend on selling the drone once it is finished, acknowledging that in addition to its sentimental value, he likes the idea of taking it out for a spin on the occasional Sunday morning or showing it off to some of his older NATO buddies who remember the vintage UAVs from back in their earlier peacekeeping days., “Michelle sometimes tells me I’m spending too much time and money on this thing,” Obama said. “But I’ve told her that this has always been my passion, that this is what I love to do. At the end of each day, all I’m thinking about is getting in this garage, sliding onto my mechanic’s dolly, and getting to work bringing this baby back to deployment condition.”, “What can I say?” the president added. “I just really connect with these machines.”, According to sources, after testing and recalibrating the propeller, the president spent another hour cleaning up the scraps of metal and foam shavings from his worksite. Observers say Obama then stood in the doorway staring reverently at the drone for several moments before turning off the light and slowly heading inside.]"

","March 26, 2014",Politics,Politicians,World Leaders,Barack Obama,,"[WASHINGTON—Armed with newly acquired strategies on team leadership, effective communication, and workplace sensitivity, President Barack Obama returned to the Oval Office this morning after spending the past three days at a management seminar, White House sources confirmed., The professional-development conference reportedly took place at the Marriott Marquis in downtown Washington, where the president joined dozens of business managers from across the mid-Atlantic region for a series of presentations, workshops, and team-building activities aimed at enhancing supervisory skills and fostering confident decision-making., “This wasn’t exactly something I wanted to do, but I figured if I was going to be there for three days I might as well make the most of it,” said Obama, noting that the seminar kicked off in the hotel’s Ballroom 2A, where he registered at the check-in table, wrote “Barack” on his name tag, and then began the first day’s session by playing the ice-breaking game Two Truths And A Lie with other attendees. “As it turns out, I got to talking to some of the other attendees, and we found out we’re faced with a lot of the same kinds of challenges, like organization and budgeting. So we bonded a little bit over that.”, “I hit it off right away with this guy Tom [Hanley, co-owner of Hanley Comprehensive Payroll Services] from Reston,” the president continued. “He runs the third-largest payroll processor in the region. We ended up sitting next to each other for most of the presentations and even grabbing a beer Tuesday in the hotel bar. Great guy.”, Obama said the seminar, called “Essentials of Effective Management: Engagement, Performance, and Execution,” used hands-on workshops to develop the creative and analytical skills of the program’s 80 attendees who represented companies from six local states and the District of Columbia, ranging from Johnson Bros. Vending to PrimeMark Commercial Real Estate. The course also reportedly focused on the four C’s of management—communicate, collaborate, coordinate, and create—a framework the president described as “an easy way to remember some pretty important stuff.”, The commander-in-chief stated that, to his surprise, he even found himself enjoying some of the seminar’s activities. In particular, Obama cited an afternoon “brain-building” exercise on day two, during which he and his teammates Don Worley and Jim Meredith, both from Baxter Tour & Travel Motorcoach Lines, were handed three seemingly random objects—a roll of tape, a tube of toothpaste, and an egg carton—and then given 30 minutes to come up with a new product and create a business model for marketing it to consumers., In the role-playing session “Tough Scenarios,” sources said Obama was paired up with Wilmington-based PR director Mary Westgerdes and presented with a series of management predicaments to act out in front of the group, such as how to confront an employee about dressing professionally and what not to say when addressing a subordinate of the opposite gender., OnPoint Marketing Solutions, LLC founder Ron Davies, who taught the 44th president in the workshops “Critical Thinking, Analytical Thinking” and “Managing at the Speed of Trust,” said he enjoyed watching Obama’s progress over the course of three days., “Barack did quite well for a first-time participant,” said Davies, recalling the president’s performance during Deduction, a game in which conference-goers had to guess one another’s favorite month, animal, food, TV show, and color. “He was really earnest about his ideas, but he wasn’t afraid to use humor, either. When we asked attendees to name their biggest weakness, he said, ‘Cooking for my wife,’ which got a pretty big laugh.”, “He worked very well under Dale [Garver], his team leader,” Davies continued. “Dale’s team really stood out during our time management challenges.”, The president remarked that he particularly enjoyed the seminar’s keynote address from Pitney Bowes regional vice president Beth Meeks, saying that she “made some good points” and “seemed to reach a lot of people” with her speech, titled “Don’t Tell Your Brand’s Story: Sell Your Brand’s Story.”, But Obama stressed that some of the best moments of the conference came when he got the opportunity to network and trade business cards with fellow attendees when he bumped into them in the Marriott hallway or during their scheduled hour-long break between morning and afternoon sessions when he and a few fellow attendees would head out to lunch at a nearby Panera Bread., “I’d say that the seminar was a good experience overall,” said the president of the United States, who received a certificate of administrative excellence for completing the three-day, $1,900 seminar. “I definitely picked up a few strategies that might help me out in cabinet meetings. Even if I don’t end up using that stuff every day, it’s not a big deal, because the whole thing was paid for by work.”, “And at least I got three days away from the office, which was nice,” he added. “Hopefully I don’t have too much piled up on my desk when I get back.”]"

He held his office with honor and served his country admirably, and as we begin the difficult task of replacing him, I want the American people to understand that the country is now poised to erupt into a vicious maelstrom of horror ungoverned by the laws of man,” said the president, urging citizens to trust no one and to stay in their homes while bedlam consumes the nation. “With a leadership void in the Department of Justice, there is no question that utter chaos and disorder will prevail and our formerly rule-bound society will descend into a cutthroat free-for-all. That is, until this administration and both sides of Congress agree on a replacement.”, “Prepare yourselves,” Obama added., Speaking from the Oval Office, the door to which appeared to have been barricaded shut, Obama then assured the nation that brutal hordes would run amok from coast to coast during the complete absence of lawful rule.

Darkness and cruelty will overtake the hearts of even the most upright civilians.”, “My administration aims to begin the nomination and hearings process some time after the November recess,” Obama added. “But pending the confirmation of a new attorney general, I urge you all: Murder or be murdered.”]"

","November 7, 2014",Politics,Politicians,Barack Obama,,,"[WASHINGTON—As an exhausted President Obama worked his way through a long and stressful week marked by his political opponents’ resounding victory in the midterm elections, sources within the White House confirmed that the commander-in-chief summoned presidential castrato Loreto Caffarelli into the Oval Office yesterday evening to soothe his fraying nerves., Dressed in silk flounces and gold filigree robes, the castrato, who since a childhood gelding procedure in 1982 has calmed five presidents with his angelic mezzo-soprano, was reportedly instructed to stand at the center of the rug bearing the presidential seal and await the request of the weary head of state, who was meeting with senior advisers., “Sing me something from The Birth Of Flowers,” Obama is reported to have said, massaging his temples as the castrated 39-year-old, known for his powerful treble voice, broke into an aria from the 17th-century opera. “Ah, yes, beautiful. Beautiful.”, “It’s just magnificent,” added Obama, who is said to have leaned back in his chair behind the Resolute desk, closing his eyes and letting out a slow sigh of relief as the presidential castrato, accompanied by lyre, delivered a performance sources described as “otherworldly.”, Caffarelli garnered favor early in Obama’s presidency with the exquisite, ethereal register of his voice, according to officials. He is often seen accompanying the nation’s chief executive to state dinners, Cabinet meetings, security briefings, 11th-hour budget negotiations, and high-powered talks with top diplomats, as well as family outings to Camp David and Martha’s Vineyard. During lengthy international trips aboard Air Force One, the president is known to dismiss his aides and spend hours listening to the castrato in rapt silence., Reports indicate Obama even relied on the neutered singer during the difficult early morning hours of the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound, calling him down to the Situation Room to perform Schubert’s “Ave Maria” on three separate occasions before rewarding him with a valuable American Buffalo gold bullion coin., According to historians, the White House castrato program dates back to 1798, when King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia presented John Adams with the gift of famed 23-year-old castrato Bruto di Somma, commonly referred to by politicians and newspapers of the time as “The Angel Voice Of Our Republic.” The melodious eunuchs have reportedly served to relax and instill focus in American presidents ever since. John F. Kennedy is said to have installed risers in the Oval Office for a castrati trio in 1962, later confiding that without their poignant performances of Handel’s “Lascia Ch’io Pianga” and Scarlatti’s Sedecia oratorio, he would not have made it through the 13 days of the Cuban missile crisis without suffering a nervous breakdown., Presidential staffers have described the tones of Caffarelli’s voice echoing through the West Wing in the evening as “haunting” and unlike either “woman or boy.”, “He truly is our White House nightingale,” said Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, who remarked that during a recent bout of presidential insomnia, the castrato was called to the bedside of Obama and the first lady, where he stood singing a selection of soothing Baroque cantatas and refilling a glass of wine on the nightstand. “I’ll never forget him being squeezed into the back of a crowded East Room to perform a Carissimi motet as the president signed the Affordable Care Act into law.”, “It was clear to me then how important this elegant virtuoso had become to all of us,” McDonough added. “There wasn’t a dry eye in the room.”, Former administration officials told reporters Caffarelli is housed in luxurious quarters below the White House’s Vermeil Room, where he engages in a rigorous training regimen: Each day, he rehearses the presidential canon of operatic classics, spending hours performing difficult trills and coloratura passages, and takes considerable time to press his cravats and meticulously maintain his collection of brocade waistcoats., The entirely beardless singer often practices in front of a mirror, sources said, so he can learn to avoid any unnecessary facial expressions that might displease the 44th president., “Like previous presidents, Obama has become incredibly protective of his castrato during his time in office,” said historian Bernard Sheckland, adding that the president has repeatedly rebuffed offers from Saudi prince Salman bin Abdulaziz to “name his price” for Caffarelli. “But like others before him, Obama demands fierce loyalty in return. You’ll recall that Nixon went through no fewer than seven presidential castrati. Their many performances—as well as their bitter, profanity-laced dismissals from service—are of course preserved on his White House tapes.”, At press time, a missed note by Caffarelli had reportedly caused Obama to smash a dish from the Reagan state china service against the wall and angrily drive the castrato out the Oval Office’s east doors.]"
